# McDonald's Q4 2025 Earnings Preview: Can the Golden Arches Keep Shining Amid Rising Costs?

McDonald’s is about to drop its Q4 2025 earnings on February 11, 2026, and investors are chomping at the bit to see if this fast-food titan can keep serving up growth while juggling rising costs and fierce competition. Last quarter, McDonald’s showed it’s still got some sizzle with solid comp sales growth and a respectable EPS bump. But with commodity prices heating up, labor costs climbing, and rivals nipping at its fries, the question is: will McDonald’s keep flipping burgers and boosting profits, or will margin pressures sour the party?

This preview digs into the numbers, the strategies behind the scenes, and the big trends that could make or break McDonald’s Q4 performance. Spoiler: digital sales, AI-powered drive-thrus, and plant-based menus are all on the table. But so are inflation headaches and regulatory hurdles. So, what’s the real story behind the Golden Arches as they head into 2026? Let’s unwrap it.

## Recent Performance Context: A Quarter That Kept the Heat On

Looking back at Q3 2025, McDonald’s wasn’t just coasting on nostalgia for the Big Mac. The company pulled in $6.3 billion in revenue, up 5.8% year-over-year—a respectable clip in the fast-food world. Earnings per share (EPS) rose 7.5% to $2.15, suggesting McDonald’s isn’t just selling more, but also squeezing out more profit per share.

Digging deeper, global comparable sales grew 5.5%, with the U.S. leading the charge at 6%, and international markets holding their own at 5%. Operating margin sat at a healthy 44.2%, a sign that despite inflationary pressures, McDonald’s has some pricing power and cost control mojo.

Franchise-operated restaurants dominate the scene (93% of stores), leaving only 7% company-operated. This franchise-heavy model helps McDonald’s spread risk and boost margin efficiency, but also means the company’s earnings depend heavily on franchise fees and royalties.

If Q3 was a warm-up, Q4 will show if McDonald’s can maintain that momentum during the holiday-heavy quarter, often a make-or-break time for retailers and restaurants.

## What the Numbers Will Tell Us: The Real Score to Watch

The consensus estimate from Refinitiv calls for Q4 revenue of $6.5 billion, a 6% year-over-year jump, and EPS of $2.30, up 7%. That’s a notch above Q3’s growth rates, hinting that analysts expect McDonald’s to leverage the holiday season and new initiatives to keep the cash registers ringing.

Here’s what we’ll be watching closely:

- **Revenue Growth:** Can McDonald’s hit or exceed that 6% growth target? Given the 7% comp sales surge reported in Asia-Pacific during the holidays and ongoing menu innovations, the outlook is cautiously optimistic. But rising beef and dairy costs could crimp margins if pricing can’t keep pace.

- **EPS Growth & Margins:** Analysts are expecting 7% EPS growth, slightly below Q3’s 7.5%, reflecting margin pressures from higher commodity and labor costs. The operating margin will be key—will McDonald’s’ efficiency gains offset inflation’s sting?

- **Digital Sales Penetration:** Digital ordering and delivery accounted for roughly 35% of sales in Q3. Any growth here means better convenience for customers and potentially better margins for McDonald’s, since digital transactions can reduce some labor costs and increase order accuracy.

- **International Performance:** The 7% comp sales growth in Asia-Pacific during the holidays is a bright spot. But how about Latin America and Europe? These emerging markets are critical for long-term growth, especially with the rising middle class and new store openings.

## Strategic Initiatives and Menu Magic: What’s Driving Growth?

McDonald’s has been cooking up some interesting moves recently, and these initiatives are the secret sauce behind its ability to keep growing:

- **Digital Ordering and Delivery:** With digital sales making up about 35% of total sales, McDonald’s is betting heavily on tech to boost convenience and sales volume. The recent partnership with an AI startup to enhance drive-thru efficiency isn’t just a flashy headline—it’s a real attempt to cut wait times and boost order accuracy. Faster service means happier customers and more throughput.

- **Menu Innovation:** Plant-based options are no longer a niche experiment. McDonald’s expanded its plant-based sandwiches and snacks across Europe after successful trials, targeting younger, health-conscious consumers. Limited-time offers also keep the menu fresh and drive foot traffic.

- **Restaurant Modernization:** Upgrading stores with the latest tech and AI-driven tools is a smart way to improve the customer experience while managing labor costs. Think smarter drive-thrus and streamlined kitchen operations.

- **Sustainability Push:** McDonald’s aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 36% by 2030. Recent pilot projects focusing on eco-friendly packaging and energy efficiency show the company is serious about green credentials—important for brand image and increasingly, regulatory compliance.

- **Emerging Market Expansion:** Asia-Pacific and Latin America are hotbeds for growth, with new stores opening faster than you can say “supersize it.” That holiday quarter 7% comp sales jump in Asia-Pacific is a sign these markets are hungry for more.

## Forward-Looking Questions: What Could Trip or Turbo-Charge McDonald’s?

Every earnings season has its wild cards. For McDonald’s, here’s what could shake things up:

- **Commodity Price Rollercoaster:** Beef and dairy inflation is no joke. If prices keep climbing faster than McDonald’s can raise menu prices without alienating customers, margins could take a hit.

- **Labor Market Headwinds:** Wage inflation and labor shortages are real challenges. Will automation and AI-driven tech investments be enough to offset these costs? Or will McDonald’s have to pay up more to keep stores staffed?

- **Competitive Heat:** Fast casual brands like Chipotle and delivery-only players are nipping at McDonald’s heels, especially for younger customers who want customization and healthier options. Can McDonald’s keep innovating fast enough?

- **Regulation and Reputation:** Nutritional labeling rules and advertising scrutiny could limit marketing flex or increase compliance costs. Sustainability efforts help, but will they be enough to keep regulators off the back?

- **Digital Sales Growth:** Will digital sales continue their upward trend beyond 35% of total sales? More digital means more data, which could help McDonald’s personalize offers and optimize menus—potentially a big win.

## The Real McDonald’s Story: What to Expect on February 11

McDonald’s Q4 2025 earnings report should show a company that’s still growing, but navigating some tricky headwinds. Expect revenue and EPS to hit analyst targets or slightly better if digital sales and international growth stay strong. Margins might feel some squeeze, but smart tech investments and menu innovation could cushion the blow.

The bigger picture is McDonald’s transformation from a burger joint into a tech-savvy, sustainability-conscious global powerhouse. The AI-powered drive-thru pilot, expanding plant-based options, and aggressive moves in emerging markets show a company that’s not resting on its Golden Arches.

But don’t expect smooth sailing. Rising commodity and labor costs remain the elephant in the room, and McDonald’s will have to keep its pricing magic trick sharp to stay ahead. Plus, competition isn’t sitting still—whether it’s Burger King, Chipotle, or Domino’s, everyone’s racing to grab customers’ wallets.

In short, McDonald’s Q4 2025 earnings will be a good check on whether the fast-food giant can keep making money while selling a mix of old favorites and newfangled menu hits in a fast-changing world. Pull up a chair and get ready—this one’s going to be tasty.
