Microsoft reported strong second-quarter results for fiscal year 2026, with revenue reaching $81.3 billion, up 17% from the same period last year. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) also showed significant gains, with non-GAAP EPS at $4.14, a 24% increase year-over-year, and GAAP EPS at $5.16, up an impressive 60%.

**Revenue Analysis**  
Microsoft’s total revenue of $81.3 billion reflects solid growth of 17% compared to Q2 FY2025, or 15% when adjusted for constant currency. This growth underscores the company’s ability to expand across its diverse business segments despite varying global economic conditions.

Net income on a non-GAAP basis climbed 23% to $30.9 billion. The strong jump in GAAP EPS to $5.16—up 60%—also signals improved bottom-line performance, driven by both higher revenues and disciplined cost control.

**Cloud and AI Driving Growth**  
A key highlight was Microsoft’s cloud business, which generated $51.5 billion in revenue, surpassing the $50 billion milestone for the first time. This segment continues to be the main engine of growth, reflecting strong demand for cloud infrastructure, software, and AI-powered solutions. Microsoft’s ongoing investments in artificial intelligence are clearly paying off, solidifying its leadership position in the rapidly expanding cloud market.

**Investor Takeaway**  
Overall, Microsoft delivered a very strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth, expanding profitability, and a cloud business that keeps breaking records. For investors, the company’s ability to capitalize on cloud and AI trends while maintaining healthy margins suggests a promising outlook as digital transformation accelerates worldwide.
