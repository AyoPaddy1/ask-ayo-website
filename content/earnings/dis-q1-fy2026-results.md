# Disney Q1 FY2026: Parks Hit Record Revenue, Streaming Profitable, CEO Succession Looms

Disney just beat Wall Street expectations with **$26.0 billion** in revenue (vs $25.6B expected) and **$1.63 adjusted EPS** (vs $1.57-1.58 expected). The stock rose **2% in premarket trading** to around $115.

But the real story isn't this quarter's numbers—it's what happens next. **Disney's board is meeting this week to vote on Bob Iger's successor**, with **Josh D'Amaro** (Disney Experiences Chairman) reportedly the frontrunner. For investors, who runs Disney next matters more than any single quarter.

The other big headline: **Disney doubled its stock buyback target to $7 billion** for fiscal 2026, signaling management confidence. And **ESPN acquired NFL Network** in exchange for a 10% ownership stake in ESPN, fundamentally restructuring ESPN's business model.

This is classic Disney: solid results, big strategic moves, and a CEO succession drama that overshadows everything.

## The Numbers

- **Revenue:** $26.0 billion (+5% YoY from $24.7B) — **beat $25.6B estimate**
- **EPS (GAAP):** $1.34 (down from $1.40 last year)
- **EPS (Adjusted):** $1.63 (down from $1.76 last year) — **beat $1.57-1.58 estimate**
- **Total segment operating income:** $4.6 billion (-9% from $5.1B)
- **Stock buybacks:** $2 billion in Q1, $7 billion target for full fiscal 2026

Disney beat on both revenue and earnings, but operating income fell 9% because of higher programming costs (Entertainment segment) and pre-launch costs for new attractions (Experiences segment).

## Experiences: $10 Billion in Quarterly Revenue (A Record)

Disney's theme parks and resorts business just had its best quarter ever. **$10.0 billion in revenue** and **$3.3 billion in operating income** (up 6% year-over-year).

Here's the breakdown:
- **Domestic parks (Disney World, Disneyland):** Attendance up 1%, per capita spending up 4%
- **International parks:** Modest growth, but headwinds from pre-opening costs for new attractions (Disney Adventure at Disney Cruise Line, World of Frozen at Disneyland Paris)

The key takeaway: **People are still spending at Disney parks**. Attendance was only up 1%, but per capita spending (how much each guest spends on tickets, food, merch) was up 4%. That's pricing power.

Disney is also investing heavily in new attractions. The **Disney Adventure cruise ship** launches soon, and **World of Frozen** opens at Disneyland Paris this year. These are expensive upfront but will drive long-term growth.

## Streaming Is Finally Profitable

Disney's streaming business (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+) is now solidly profitable. Revenue grew **11% year-over-year** (adjusting for the Star India impact in the prior year), and Disney guided to a **10% operating margin** for streaming in fiscal 2026.

This is a huge milestone. For years, Disney was losing billions on streaming as it built out Disney+ to compete with Netflix. Now it's profitable and expanding margins.

The growth came from:
- **Higher subscription fees** (Disney+ raised prices in late 2025)
- **More subscribers** (Disney didn't disclose exact numbers, but implied growth)
- **Better cost discipline** (less spending on content that doesn't drive engagement)

Disney's streaming strategy is working: raise prices, focus on quality content (not quantity), and let profitability grow. It's the opposite of what they did in 2020-2023 when they were chasing Netflix's subscriber count at any cost.

## Entertainment Segment: Fubo Acquisition Boosts Growth

The **Entertainment segment** (movies, TV, streaming content) posted revenue growth of 7% year-over-year. But here's the catch: **Disney closed a 70% acquisition of Fubo** (a live TV streaming service) in October 2025, which is now included in the Entertainment segment numbers.

So part of that 7% growth is acquisition-driven, not organic. Without Fubo, the growth would have been lower.

The segment's theatrical revenue was strong in Q1, driven by:
- **Zootopia 2** (released December 2025, strong box office performer)
- New **Avatar** and **Predator** franchise installments

Disney's theatrical slate is back on track after a few years of underperformance. That matters because theatrical releases drive downstream revenue (streaming, merchandise, theme park attractions).

## Sports (ESPN): The NFL Network Deal

ESPN posted **$191 million in operating income**, down $56 million year-over-year. Why? **YouTube TV temporarily suspended ESPN's carriage**, costing Disney about **$110 million** in lost revenue.

But the big story is the **NFL Network acquisition**. In January 2026, **ESPN acquired NFL Network and certain other NFL media assets** in exchange for **the NFL taking a 10% ownership stake in ESPN**. The NFL also has an option to buy an additional 4% stake, and Disney can buy back the 10% stake starting in July 2034 using a 10-year note.

This is a game-changer. ESPN now owns the NFL's media assets, which strengthens its position as the dominant sports network. And the NFL's 10% stake aligns the league's incentives with ESPN's success, making it easier to negotiate future rights deals.

The trade-off: Disney diluted its ownership of ESPN. But for a company preparing to launch ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2026, having the NFL as a partner (and part-owner) is worth it.

ESPN's advertising revenue grew 10%, showing that live sports advertising is still strong. The challenge is subscription and affiliate fees, which fell as cable TV continues its slow decline.

## CEO Succession: Who's Next?

**Disney's board is meeting this week to vote on Bob Iger's successor**, and **Josh D'Amaro** (Chairman of Disney Experiences) is reportedly the frontrunner.

D'Amaro has run Disney's most profitable division (theme parks and resorts) and delivered record results in Q1. If he gets the job, it signals Disney is prioritizing operational excellence and profitability over flashy content deals.

The other candidates reportedly include executives from the content side (Entertainment and streaming), but D'Amaro's track record at Experiences makes him the safe choice.

For investors, this is the biggest Disney story of 2026. Iger has been CEO (on and off) since 2005, and his successor will shape Disney's strategy for the next decade. Will Disney double down on streaming? Invest more in parks? Sell assets like ABC or ESPN? The new CEO will decide.

## What Disney Said About the Future

Disney's guidance for FY2026 (full year):
- **Entertainment segment:** "Double digit segment OI growth" (weighted to second half of the year)
- **SVOD (streaming):** Operating margin of 10%
- **Sports (ESPN):** "Low-single digit segment OI growth"
- **Experiences (parks):** "High-single digit growth in segment OI" (weighted to second half)
- **Adjusted EPS:** "Double digit growth"
- **Cash from operations:** $19 billion
- **Stock buybacks:** $7 billion for fiscal 2026 (doubled from previous target)

Translation: Disney expects the second half of FY2026 to be much stronger than the first half. That's typical for Disney—theme parks are busier in summer, and the holiday movie slate drives Q4 revenue.

The **$7 billion buyback target** is the headline. Disney completed $2 billion in buybacks in Q1 and is committing to another $5 billion over the next three quarters. That's a strong signal that management believes the stock is undervalued.

## The Bottom Line

Disney's Q1 was solid and beat expectations:
- **Parks hit a record $10B in quarterly revenue** (pricing power intact)
- **Streaming is profitable** and expanding margins to 10%
- **Entertainment segment growing** (partly due to Fubo acquisition)
- **ESPN acquired NFL Network** (NFL now owns 10% of ESPN)
- **$7 billion stock buyback** signals management confidence

The stock rose 4% in premarket trading because Disney beat estimates and announced a massive buyback. But the real story is the **CEO succession vote happening this week**. Josh D'Amaro is the reported frontrunner, and if he gets the job, expect Disney to focus on operational excellence (parks, profitability) over content splashy deals.

The big question for 2026: Can Disney maintain pricing power at its parks while also growing attendance? And can streaming margins expand to 10% as promised?

If yes, Disney's stock will keep climbing. If not, expect the new CEO to face intense scrutiny from day one.
