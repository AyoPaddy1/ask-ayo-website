# Microsoft Q2 FY2026 Earnings: Beat Expectations, Stock Still Tanks 10%

Microsoft just reported a solid quarter — revenue of **$81.3 billion** (up 17%), earnings per share of **$4.14** (up 24%), and cloud revenue crossing **$51.5 billion** for the first time.

So why did the stock drop 10% the next day?

Because investors are nervous about two things: **Azure growth slowing down** and **record AI spending** that might not pay off.

## The Numbers Look Good... On Paper

Let's start with what went right:

- **Revenue:** $81.3B (up 17% year-over-year, or 15% in constant currency)
- **EPS (non-GAAP):** $4.14 (up 24%)
- **Cloud revenue:** $51.5B (crossed the $50B milestone)
- **Azure growth:** 39% year-over-year

All of these beat analyst expectations. Microsoft is making more money than ever.

But here's the catch: **Azure grew 39%, but analysts expected 39.4%**. That 0.4% miss might sound tiny, but when you're Microsoft and Azure is your entire growth story, investors freak out.

## The Real Problem: $37.5 Billion in One Quarter

Microsoft spent **$37.5 billion on capital expenditures (capex)** in Q2. That's a record. Most of it went to building AI data centers and buying Nvidia GPUs to power Azure's AI services.

To put that in perspective:
- Q2 2025 capex: ~$20B
- Q2 2026 capex: $37.5B

That's an 87% increase in one year. Investors are asking: "Are you spending too much on AI before you know if it'll actually make money?"

Microsoft's bet is that AI will drive Azure growth for years to come. But right now, Azure growth is slowing (39% is still good, but it was 50%+ a year ago), and the spending is accelerating. That mismatch is what spooked the market.

## The OpenAI One-Off

Microsoft also reported **GAAP EPS of $5.16**, which is up 60% year-over-year. That sounds amazing, but it's misleading.

That $5.16 includes a **one-time $7.6 billion gain** from Microsoft's investment in OpenAI. Basically, OpenAI's valuation went up, and Microsoft's stake became worth more on paper. But that's not recurring earnings — it's a one-off accounting boost.

Strip out the OpenAI gain, and the real EPS is $4.14 (the non-GAAP number). Still up 24%, which is solid, but not the 60% headline.

## What This Means for Investors

Here's the situation:
- Microsoft is still growing fast (17% revenue growth is strong for a $3 trillion company)
- Azure is still the leader in cloud computing
- But growth is slowing, and spending is accelerating

The stock dropped 10% because investors are worried that Microsoft is spending too much on AI infrastructure before proving it'll generate returns. It's a classic "show me the money" moment.

If Azure growth picks back up in the next few quarters, the stock will recover. If it keeps slowing while capex stays high, investors will get more nervous.

## The Bottom Line

Microsoft beat earnings, but the market didn't care. The Azure miss (even though it was tiny) and the record $37.5B capex spend were enough to spook investors.

This is a good reminder that earnings aren't just about the numbers — it's about the story. And right now, Microsoft's story is: "We're spending a fortune on AI, and we're not sure when it'll pay off."

For long-term investors, this might be a buying opportunity. For short-term traders, it's a warning sign.
