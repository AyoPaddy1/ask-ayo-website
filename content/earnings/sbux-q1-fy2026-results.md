# Starbucks Q1 FY2026: The Turnaround Is Real

Starbucks just posted something it hasn't done in two years: **positive comparable transaction growth** in the US. Transactions were up **3%** year-over-year, marking the first time since Q1 FY2024 that more people actually walked into Starbucks stores.

This is the Brian Niccol effect.

## The Numbers

Revenue hit **$9.9 billion**, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP EPS came in at **$0.56**, down 19% due to labor investments and higher coffee costs (more on that in a second).

But the real story is in the comparable store sales:
- **Global comp sales: +4%** (3% transactions, 1% ticket)
- **US comp sales: +4%** (3% transactions, 1% ticket)  
- **China comp sales: +7%** (5% transactions, 2% ticket)

Translation: People are coming back to Starbucks. Not just buying more expensive drinks—actually showing up more often.

## Why This Matters

Starbucks has been bleeding customers for eight straight quarters. Traffic was down, wait times were up, and the whole "third place" coffeehouse vibe had turned into a mobile order pickup station.

Brian Niccol (the guy who turned Chipotle around) took over as CEO in September 2025. His "Back to Starbucks" strategy focuses on:
- Faster service (less waiting around)
- Better in-store experience (actual coffeehouse atmosphere)
- Simpler menu (stop confusing baristas with 47 customization options)

This quarter is proof it's working. Niccol himself said: "We believe we're ahead of schedule."

## The China Story

Here's the weird part: Starbucks is **selling 60% of its China business** to Boyu Capital in a joint venture deal (closing Spring 2026), but China comp sales grew **7%** this quarter.

Why sell if things are going well? Because China is brutally competitive. Local brands like Luckin Coffee are everywhere, and Starbucks needs a local partner to compete long-term. The joint venture lets Starbucks keep 40% ownership and the brand rights while Boyu handles operations.

## Margins Got Crushed

Operating margin fell from **11.9%** to **9.0%** (GAAP). Why?
- **Labor investments**: Niccol is staffing stores properly to improve service. That costs money.
- **Coffee prices**: Elevated coffee costs hit margins.
- **Tariffs**: Import tariffs added pressure.

CFO Cathy Smith said the plan is to "translate topline strength into sustainable earnings growth." Translation: We're investing now to fix the business, profits will follow.

## What Starbucks Said About the Future

The company introduced **FY2026 guidance** for the first time under Niccol. They're expecting:
- Continued comparable store sales growth
- Margin pressure to ease as efficiency improves
- China joint venture to close in Spring 2026

No specific numbers, but the tone is optimistic.

## The Bottom Line

This is the first real evidence that Niccol's turnaround is working. Comp transactions are positive, traffic is back, and the "Back to Starbucks" strategy is gaining traction.

The margin hit is temporary—Starbucks is investing in labor and service to win customers back. If traffic keeps growing, margins will recover.

One thing to watch: Starbucks is still selling the China business. If that deal falls through or takes longer than expected, it could create uncertainty. But for now, the turnaround story is real.
