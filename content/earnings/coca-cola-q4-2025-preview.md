# Coca-Cola Q4 2025 Earnings Preview: Can Pricing Power Survive the Volume Drought?

Coca-Cola reports Q4 2025 earnings on February 10, 2026. Analysts expect $0.56 per share—a modest 1.8% bump from last year. But here's the real story: Coca-Cola has spent 2025 perfecting the art of making more money while selling less stuff. The question isn't whether they'll beat estimates (they've done that four quarters in a row). The question is whether this pricing magic trick can keep working.

## The Pricing Power Playbook

In Q3 2025, Coca-Cola pulled off something remarkable. Revenue grew 6% organically, driven entirely by a 6% increase in price and mix. Unit case volume? Up just 1%. Translation: They sold barely more soda, but charged significantly more for it. Operating margins hit 31.9%—a number that would make any CFO grin.

This is what Wall Street calls "premiumization," but let's be honest about what's happening. Coca-Cola is testing how much consumers will pay before they start buying store-brand cola instead. So far, the answer is "quite a lot." The company gained market share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages even while raising prices. That's the kind of pricing power that only a brand with 140 years of marketing muscle can pull off.

But there are cracks forming. Volume growth of 1% isn't growth—it's treading water. And in January 2026, Coca-Cola announced 75 layoffs at headquarters as part of a restructuring initiative. Companies don't restructure when everything's going great. They restructure when they see storm clouds ahead.

## What the Numbers Will Tell Us

Analysts are expecting Q4 revenue of $10.69 billion, down 1.5% year-over-year. That decline isn't a red flag—Q4 is typically Coca-Cola's weakest quarter due to holiday timing and seasonal patterns. The real test is whether they can maintain that 5-6% organic revenue growth they've been promising for the full year.

Here's what matters more than the headline numbers. First, watch the split between volume and price/mix. If volume growth stays stuck at 1% or worse, it signals consumers are reaching their limit. Second, check operating margins. Coca-Cola has been hovering around 32%, but currency headwinds and rising input costs are squeezing from both sides. Third, listen carefully to the 2026 guidance. If management starts talking about "investing in volume growth" or "competitive pricing," that's code for "we pushed too hard and now we're backing off."

The company has told investors to expect a 4-5% currency headwind on Q4 earnings per share, partially offset by a slight tailwind on revenue. Currency fluctuations are the background noise of global business, but they matter because Coca-Cola operates in over 200 countries. A strong dollar means profits earned in pesos, rupees, and yuan shrink when converted back to dollars. It's not a reflection of business performance—it's just math. But it still hits the bottom line.

## The Portfolio Pivot

Coca-Cola isn't just selling more expensive Coke. They're quietly reshaping what they sell. In Q3, their ready-to-drink tea portfolio maintained global leadership, with Fuze Tea growing at five times the industry average. Their dual-brand sports drink strategy—Powerade and BODYARMOR—is gaining market share. In Mexico, their dairy brand Santa Clara became the value share leader with 13% volume growth.

This matters because it's insurance against the volume drought in core carbonated soft drinks. CEO James Quincey has been explicit about shifting toward protein products and functional beverages. That's not just corporate speak—it's a recognition that consumers, especially younger ones, are drinking less soda. The company that built its empire on Coca-Cola Classic is now betting big on fairlife protein shakes and lactose-free milk.

The January 2026 leadership changes reinforce this pivot. Coca-Cola announced a reorganization focused on "consumer-centric execution and enterprise-wide digital transformation." Translation: They're trying to act less like a 140-year-old soda company and more like a modern beverage platform. Whether that works is a multi-year question, but Q4 results will offer early clues about whether the portfolio diversification is offsetting soda weakness.

## The 2026 Question

Wall Street analysts have slapped a "Strong Buy" rating on Coca-Cola with a price target of $80.83—implying 14.7% upside from current levels. That optimism is built on the assumption that Coca-Cola can keep delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth and high-single-digit earnings growth. But that assumption rests on a foundation of sustained pricing power.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: You can't raise prices forever. At some point, consumers trade down to cheaper alternatives, or they just buy less. Coca-Cola has been threading this needle brilliantly, using marketing, brand strength, and product innovation to justify higher prices. But the restructuring announced in January suggests management knows they're approaching the limits of this strategy.

Q4 earnings will reveal whether Coca-Cola is still in the sweet spot—where they can charge more without losing customers—or whether they're entering the danger zone where volume declines start accelerating. Watch for any mention of "promotional activity" or "competitive intensity" in the earnings call. Those are euphemisms for "we had to cut prices to keep customers."

The other wildcard is regulatory pressure. Governments around the world are increasingly targeting sugary drinks with taxes, warning labels, and advertising restrictions. Coca-Cola has responded by expanding zero-sugar options—Minute Maid Zero Sugar is now rolling out in Asia Pacific markets—but regulatory headwinds could force the company to accelerate that shift faster than they'd like.

## What to Expect on February 10

Coca-Cola will almost certainly beat the $0.56 earnings estimate. They've beaten expectations in each of the last four quarters, and Q4 doesn't look particularly challenging. The company has guided for full-year organic revenue growth of 5-6% and comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of around 8%. Barring a disaster, they'll hit those targets.

But the real story will be in the guidance for 2026 and the tone management strikes about pricing versus volume. If CEO James Quincey sounds confident about maintaining pricing power and continuing the premiumization strategy, the stock will likely rally. If he starts hedging—talking about "balanced growth" or "investing in volume"—that's a signal the pricing party is ending.

Coca-Cola has built one of the most powerful brands in human history. That brand gives them pricing power that most companies can only dream about. But even the strongest brands have limits. Q4 earnings will show whether Coca-Cola is still comfortably inside those limits, or whether they're starting to push too far.

The market is betting on the former. The restructuring and leadership changes suggest management is preparing for the latter. We'll know more on February 10.
