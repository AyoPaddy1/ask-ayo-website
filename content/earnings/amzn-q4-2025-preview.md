# Amazon Q4 2025 Earnings Preview: AWS Margins Under Pressure as AI Spending Surges

Amazon reports Q4 2025 earnings **Thursday, February 6** after market close. Wall Street expects **$211.3 billion in revenue** (up 13% year-over-year) and **$1.97 adjusted EPS** (up 5.7%).

The headline story: **Amazon raised its 2025 capex guidance to $125 billion** (mostly for AWS data centers and AI infrastructure), and investors want to know if that spending is paying off in AWS growth and margins.

Here's what to watch when Amazon reports.

## The Expectations

**Revenue:** $211.3 billion (up 13% from $187.4B in Q4 2024)  
**Adjusted EPS:** $1.97 (up 5.7% from $1.86 in Q4 2024)  
**AWS revenue:** ~$36 billion (up 20% year-over-year)  
**AWS operating margin:** 35-38% (facing tough year-over-year comparisons)  
**Capex:** $125 billion for full year 2025 (up from $75B in 2024)

If Amazon hits these numbers, it will mark another solid quarter of double-digit revenue growth. The question is whether AWS margins can hold up as Amazon pours money into AI infrastructure.

## What to Watch: AWS Growth and Margins

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is the story everyone's watching. Analysts expect **~$36 billion in revenue** (up 20% year-over-year), making it Amazon's most profitable segment.

In Q3 2025, AWS posted **$33 billion in revenue** (up 20%) with operating margins around 38%. The question for Q4: Can AWS maintain that 20% growth rate and 35-38% margin?

**Why margins matter:** Amazon is spending $125 billion on capex in 2025 (up from $75 billion in 2024), with the vast majority going to AWS data centers and AI infrastructure (GPUs, custom chips). If AWS margins compress below 35%, it signals that Amazon is spending more on infrastructure than it's earning back in revenue.

**The bull case:** AWS growth accelerates above 20% as businesses migrate to AWS for AI workloads (training models, running inference). Margins stay above 35% because Amazon's custom AI chips (Trainium, Inferentia) reduce costs.

**The bear case:** AWS growth slows below 20% as competition from Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure intensifies. Margins compress below 35% because Amazon is overspending on AI infrastructure without corresponding revenue growth.

## What to Watch: Retail Margins

Amazon's **retail business** (e-commerce, Prime, third-party marketplace) is expected to post **~$175 billion in revenue** in Q4 (up 10-12% year-over-year). That's solid growth, but the question is **operating margins**.

In Q3 2025, Amazon's North America segment posted **7.8% operating margin**. If that improves to 8-9% in Q4, it signals that Amazon's cost-cutting efforts (layoffs, fulfillment optimization) are working.

**What to watch:**
- **Prime membership growth** (Amazon hasn't disclosed exact numbers recently, but any update will move the stock)
- **Third-party seller fees** (Amazon takes a cut of every sale on its marketplace—higher fees = higher margins)
- **Advertising revenue** (Amazon's ad business is growing 20%+ per year and has 50%+ margins)

Amazon's retail business is mature (10-12% growth), but if margins expand, it becomes a cash machine to fund AWS expansion.

## What to Watch: AI Capex and 2026 Guidance

The biggest wildcard is **2026 capex guidance**. Amazon spent $125 billion in 2025, and analysts expect **$130-150 billion in 2026** to keep building out AWS AI infrastructure.

Meta just guided to **$115-135 billion in capex** for 2026, and the stock dropped 8% because investors worried about profitability. If Amazon announces a similar or higher capex number, expect the stock to react negatively—even if Q4 results are strong.

**The bull case:** Amazon's $125 billion in capex is building a moat. AWS is the leader in cloud infrastructure, and spending now will lock in customers for the next decade. The capex will pay off in higher AWS revenue and margins by 2027-2028.

**The bear case:** Amazon is overspending on AI without a clear path to profitability. If AWS growth slows or margins compress, all that capex will look wasteful. Investors will demand Amazon cut spending and return cash to shareholders (buybacks, dividends).

## What to Watch: Layoffs and Cost-Cutting

Amazon announced its **largest layoff ever** in January 2026, cutting over 20,000 jobs across AWS, retail, and corporate functions. This is part of CEO Andy Jassy's push to improve operating margins.

**What to watch in the earnings call:**
- **How much will the layoffs save?** (Analysts estimate $2-3 billion per year)
- **Will Amazon do more layoffs in 2026?** (If margins don't improve, expect more cuts)
- **Is Amazon shifting headcount from retail to AWS?** (Some of the layoffs are redeployments, not pure cuts)

If Amazon announces significant cost savings from the layoffs, expect the stock to rally. If the layoffs are smaller than expected, investors will worry that Amazon isn't serious about profitability.

## The Bull Case

**Why Amazon could beat expectations:**
- **AWS growth accelerates above 20%** (AI demand is stronger than expected)
- **AWS margins stay above 35%** (custom chips are reducing costs)
- **Retail margins expand to 8-9%** (cost-cutting is working)
- **Advertising revenue beats estimates** (Amazon's ad business is growing 20%+)
- **2026 capex guidance is moderate** ($130-140B, not $150B+)

If Amazon delivers on all of these, the stock could rally 5-10% and push toward $270 per share.

## The Bear Case

**Why Amazon could disappoint:**
- **AWS growth slows below 20%** (competition from Google and Microsoft is intensifying)
- **AWS margins compress below 35%** (AI spending is eating into profitability)
- **Retail margins stay flat at 7-8%** (cost-cutting isn't working)
- **2026 capex guidance spikes to $150B+** (investors panic about overspending)
- **Layoffs don't deliver expected savings** (Amazon isn't serious about profitability)

If Amazon disappoints on any of these, the stock could drop 5-10%, especially after a strong 2025 run.

## The Bottom Line

Amazon's Q4 earnings will answer one question: **Can AWS maintain 20% growth and 35%+ margins while Amazon spends $125 billion on AI infrastructure?**

If AWS delivers strong growth and margins, the stock will keep climbing. If AWS growth slows or margins compress, expect investors to question whether Amazon's massive AI spending is worth it.

**Watch for:**
- AWS revenue and growth rate (target: 20%+)
- AWS operating margin (target: 35%+)
- Retail operating margin (target: 8-9%)
- 2026 capex guidance (risk: $150B+)
- Layoff cost savings (target: $2-3B per year)
