const e=`# Apple Q4 FY2024 Earnings: What They Actually Said

**Company:** Apple Inc. (AAPL)  
**Quarter:** Q4 FY2024 (July - September 2024)

## The 30-Second Version

Apple posted a record September quarter with $94.9 billion in revenue, up 6% from last year. iPhone grew in every region. Services hit an all-time high at nearly $25 billion. But there's a giant asterisk on this quarter: Apple had to pay $10.2 billion to Ireland after losing an EU tax case, which crushed reported earnings. Greater China came in basically flat, missing expectations. The real story here is Apple Intelligence just launched, and management is betting it'll drive the next iPhone upgrade cycle. Early signs show iOS 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as last year's update.

## The Numbers

| Metric | Actual | Expected | Result |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Revenue | $94.9B | $94.36B | ✅ Beat |
| EPS (adjusted) | $1.64 | $1.60 | ✅ Beat |
| Greater China Revenue | $15.03B | $15.8B | ❌ Miss |

A quick note on earnings: The reported EPS was $0.97, down 34% from last year. But that's because of a one-time $10.2 billion tax charge from losing an EU case about tax arrangements with Ireland. Excluding that charge, EPS was $1.64, up 12%. This is one of those situations where the "adjusted" number actually tells you more about the business than the GAAP number.

## What's Actually Happening

### Services Is the Real Growth Engine

Services revenue hit $24.97 billion, an all-time record and up 12% year over year. This segment now has over 1 billion paid subscriptions. To put that in context: Services revenue is now more than double what it was five years ago.

Why this matters: Services run at about 74% gross margin versus 36% for products. Every dollar Apple shifts from hardware to services drops more profit to the bottom line. The company generated $96 billion in services revenue for full fiscal year 2024.

### iPhone: Solid but Not Spectacular

iPhone revenue was $46.22 billion, up 5.5% and a September quarter record. That's good, but the real question everyone's asking: will Apple Intelligence drive a meaningful upgrade cycle?

Tim Cook's take: iOS 18.1 adoption is running at twice the rate of iOS 17.1 adoption at the same point. That suggests people are interested in the AI features. But Cook was careful to note that most Apple Intelligence features are still rolling out through December, and international versions won't arrive until April 2025.

### Greater China: The Problem Child

China revenue came in at $15.03 billion, essentially flat year over year but missing analyst expectations of $15.8 billion. This is Apple's third-largest market, and it's been a sore spot for several quarters now.

Cook tried to spin it positively, noting that Apple had the top two selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar, and that the installed base of active devices hit an all-time high. But the reality is that Huawei and domestic competitors are eating into Apple's share, especially outside major cities.

Early data from Counterpoint shows iPhone 16 sales were up 20% versus iPhone 15 in the first three weeks in China. But that wasn't enough to offset weakness in older model sales, so total iPhone sales in China were still down 2%.

### India: The Bright Spot

While China struggles, India set an all-time revenue record. Cook specifically called this out as an exciting market. Apple is betting that India becomes its next major growth driver as the middle class expands.

## The Big Question

**Will Apple Intelligence actually drive an upgrade cycle?**

This is the $3 trillion question (literally, that's roughly Apple's market cap). Management is clearly betting on it. Here's what we know:

The good: iOS 18.1 adoption is 2x faster than iOS 17.1. Features are genuinely useful (writing tools, smarter Siri, photo cleanup). Apple's privacy-first approach resonates with users concerned about AI.

The wait-and-see: Apple Intelligence only works on iPhone 15 Pro and newer. That's a small percentage of the installed base today. Features are rolling out in phases through December. International languages won't arrive until April 2025.

Cook's candid admission: "We believe that AI-driven features are a compelling upgrade reason." Believe is doing a lot of heavy lifting there. He's not claiming it's already happening, just that he thinks it will.

## What Management Said

> "Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple Innovation."
> — Tim Cook, CEO

Cook is betting big on AI as the next upgrade driver. "New chapter" is significant language from a company that doesn't hype easily. They need Apple Intelligence to give people a reason to buy new iPhones beyond incremental camera improvements.

> "We've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years."
> — Luca Maestri, CFO (in his final earnings call before retiring)

Apple has been spending around $30 billion annually on R&D. Maestri is saying that investment is now paying off with Apple Intelligence. It's also a subtle reminder that Apple plays the long game.

> "We had the top two selling smartphones in urban China."
> — Tim Cook, on China performance

Cook is threading a needle here. China overall is tough, but Apple is still winning in wealthy urban areas. The emphasis on "urban" is telling. Outside major cities, domestic competitors like Huawei are eating Apple's lunch.

## Jargon, Explained

**Installed Base:** The total number of Apple devices currently being used by people worldwide. Apple doesn't give exact numbers anymore, but they say it hit an all-time high across all products. This matters because a bigger installed base means more potential Services revenue.

**GAAP vs Non-GAAP earnings:** GAAP is the official accounting standard (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). Non-GAAP excludes one-time items like that $10.2 billion EU tax payment. When a company has unusual items, comparing adjusted numbers year-over-year tells you more about underlying business performance.

**Private Cloud Compute:** Apple's approach to running AI in the cloud while maintaining privacy. Instead of sending your data to a general AI server, Apple uses dedicated secure chips that process requests without storing your data. It's their answer to "yes we use cloud AI, but we're not reading your stuff."

## What's Next?

**Q1 FY2025 Guidance:**
- Revenue: Low to mid-single digit growth year over year
- Services: Double-digit growth (similar to FY2024 rate of 12%)
- Gross margin: 46-47%
- OpEx: $15.3-15.5 billion

The December quarter is always Apple's biggest, with holiday sales and the full iPhone 16 cycle. Management seems cautiously optimistic but isn't promising a blowout. Watch for updates on Apple Intelligence adoption and any China recovery signs.

**Key Dates:**
- January 30, 2025: Q1 FY2025 earnings (December quarter)
- New Apple Intelligence features rolling out through December
- International Apple Intelligence languages: April 2025

## The Bottom Line

This was a solid quarter that showed Apple can still grow, but it raised as many questions as it answered. Services remains the profit engine. iPhone is holding steady. China is struggling.

The next twelve months will tell us whether Apple Intelligence is the real deal or just a "nice to have." If Cook is right that AI features are a compelling upgrade reason, we should see it in the December and March quarters as more features roll out.

For now, Apple is a company executing well on its current playbook while betting big on AI as the next growth driver. Whether that bet pays off is the biggest question facing the stock.
