const e=`# Lululemon Q3 FY2024 Earnings: What They Actually Said

*Published: December 5, 2024*

---

## The 30-Second Version

Lululemon crushed expectations with revenue up 9% to $2.4 billion and earnings of $2.87 per share (way above the $2.71 expected). The secret sauce? International growth, especially China Mainland up 39%. The problem? The Americas grew just 2%, and US comparable sales were actually negative. CEO Calvin McDonald says newness in the product lineup will return to "historical levels" by Q1 2025. Translation: they know they got stale, and they're fixing it.

## Beat or Miss?

| Metric | What Lululemon Reported | What Wall Street Expected | Verdict |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Revenue | $2.40 billion | $2.36 billion | ✅ Beat by 2% |
| Earnings Per Share | $2.87 | $2.71 | ✅ Beat by 6% |

**Real Talk:** This is a genuine beat, not just low expectations. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year, and EPS jumped 13% versus last year. Gross margin expanded 40 basis points. The company also raised its full-year guidance. That's the kind of quarter that makes investors happy.

## The Trends That Matter

### China Mainland: The Growth Engine

Revenue up 39% (36% in constant currency). Comparable sales up 24%.

**Real Talk:** While Nike struggles in China, Lululemon is absolutely flying. They're benefiting from China's "Healthy China 2030" government initiative that promotes active lifestyles. Their brand positioning around "wellness" resonates culturally in a way that Western sportswear competitors haven't cracked. They hosted activations across nine cities for World Mental Health Day with 15,000 participants and 3.8 billion impressions. That's serious brand building.

### Rest of World: Double-Digit Momentum

Revenue up 27% (23% in constant currency). Comparable sales up 20%.

**Real Talk:** Europe and Asia Pacific are still early innings for Lululemon. Their biggest Australian store (Melbourne Emporium, 11,000 sq ft) is on track to be their #1 revenue store in the region. They're also expanding: Italy launches as a company-operated market in 2025, plus Denmark, Belgium, Turkey, and Czech Republic through franchise.

### The Americas: The Problem Child

Revenue up just 2%. Comparable sales DOWN 2%. US revenue was flat.

**Real Talk:** This is where Lululemon stumbled. The US business has stalled because the product lineup got boring. CEO Calvin McDonald was unusually direct about this: they had "fewer updates to core and seasonal styles" and "limited changes in color, print, patterns and silhouettes." In plain English: women walked into stores and didn't see enough new stuff to buy.

### The Newness Problem (and Fix)

Seasonal newness as a percentage of the assortment has been below historical levels for much of 2024.

**Real Talk:** Lululemon knows exactly what went wrong. Their product team was too slow updating styles and colours. McDonald restructured the whole organisation: the Global Creative Director now reports directly to him, and Merchandising is now integrated with Brand under Chief Brand and Product Activation Officer Nikki Neuburger. They've been "chasing" into colors, prints, and patterns since Q2. By Q1 2025, they expect to be back at "historical levels" of newness. If you're a Lululemon shopper, expect more fresh options by spring.

### Channel Performance

Store sales: Up 13%. Digital: Up 4%.

**Real Talk:** Physical retail is outperforming e-commerce. That's partly because they're opening stores in high-growth international markets and optimizing existing locations. The US had a particularly strong Black Friday at full price, which is notable given how promotional the overall retail environment was.

## The Money Question

### Margins Are Holding

Gross margin: 58.5%, up 40 basis points from last year's adjusted 58.1%.

**Real Talk:** For every £100 Lululemon makes, they keep about £58 after paying for products and getting them to stores. That's exceptional for apparel (compare to Nike around 44%). The improvement came from lower inventory provisions and better product costs, partially offset by higher freight. Importantly, markdowns were flat year-over-year, meaning they're not discounting their way to sales.

### The Premium Position Works

Operating margin: 20.5%, up 70 basis points from last year.

**Real Talk:** Lululemon continues to prove that premium pricing works if the product delivers. They're one of the few athletic apparel companies that doesn't run site-wide sales. Black Friday was about clearing "end of season" styles, not discounting new stuff.

### Inventory Is Clean

Inventory up just 8%, better than the expected mid-teens increase.

**Real Talk:** This is good news. Healthy inventory means less need for markdowns. They'll build inventory heading into Q4 (expected mid-teens by year-end), but that's intentional to support the newness push into Q1 2025.

### Returning Cash to Shareholders

Share repurchases: $409 million in Q3, $1.4 billion year-to-date. Board added another $1 billion authorization.

**Real Talk:** Lululemon is using its cash to buy back stock rather than pay dividends. With the stock down significantly from its highs, this signals management believes the shares are undervalued.

## What Management Said

**CEO Calvin McDonald on the US fix:**

"We are on track with our efforts to increase the penetration of seasonal newness and expect to be in line with historical levels in Q1 2025."

**Real Talk:** This is the whole ballgame for US recovery. Product got boring, they know it, and spring 2025 is when it should be fixed. If Q1 newness disappoints, expect the stock to get hit.

**On Black Friday:**

"Unlike others in this space, we do not run sale events across our entire store. We leverage the increased traffic to clear through product we are not taking forward and to feature full-price styles."

**Real Talk:** This is the Lululemon formula. Don't compete on price. They had their most visits ever to their shop app and website on Black Friday, and full-price Define jackets were among the top sellers.

**On US brand awareness:**

"Our unaided brand awareness remains low in the US at 36%, which provides a significant opportunity for growth."

**Real Talk:** Only about a third of Americans can name Lululemon without prompting. That sounds bad, but it's actually opportunity. Nike is probably 90%+. Lululemon has room to grow awareness, especially with men.

**On Power of Three x2:**

"We remain committed to delivering on our Power of Three x2 revenue target of $12.5 billion in 2026, and we remain ahead of schedule."

**Real Talk:** The three-year plan is on track despite the US hiccup. Their growth CAGR from 2021-2024 is 19%, ahead of the 15% target.

## What Analysts Pushed On

**When will the US improve?**

McDonald promised newness returns to historical levels in Q1 2025. He pointed to strong guest retention and 24 million membership program members as proof the brand is healthy. The issue is entirely about product freshness, not demand.

**Why is digital growing slower than stores?**

Traffic to digital was positive, but conversion is the challenge. In physical stores, the experience and staff expertise drive purchases. Online, without new products to browse, shoppers leave without buying.

**What about tariffs?**

CFO Meghan Frank noted Lululemon sources only about 3% from China and less than 0.5% from Mexico. Their tariff exposure is relatively limited compared to competitors.

## The Bottom Line

Lululemon delivered a genuinely good quarter globally, but the US business exposed a real problem: they let the product lineup get stale. The good news is they've diagnosed it honestly and have a specific timeline (Q1 2025) for the fix.

International is the star here. China up 39% while Nike's China business crashed 17% tells you something about brand positioning and execution. Lululemon's wellness-focused positioning is resonating in ways that pure athletic wear isn't.

The company maintains exceptional margins (58.5% gross, 20.5% operating), doesn't need to discount, and has brand loyalty that other apparel companies dream of. Guest retention is high. The membership program has 24 million members.

If you believe in the brand and the newness fix, this is a quality company trading well below its highs. If you're skeptical that product changes can reignite US growth, the next two quarters will prove it one way or another.

**One number to remember:** China grew 39%. That's the proof that when Lululemon executes well, the demand is there. The US fix is about execution, not demand.
