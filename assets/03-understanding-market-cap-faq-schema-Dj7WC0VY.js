const e=[{"@type":"Question",name:"What is market cap?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Market cap (market capitalization) is the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It's calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of shares outstanding. For example, if a company has 1 billion shares trading at $50 each, its market cap is $50 billion."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"How do you calculate market cap?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Market Cap = Stock Price × Total Shares Outstanding. For example, if Company ABC's stock trades at $75 and there are 500 million shares outstanding, the market cap is $37.5 billion ($75 × 500 million = $37.5 billion)."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"What are the different market cap categories?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Companies are categorized by market cap size: Mega-cap (over $200 billion), Large-cap ($10-200 billion), Mid-cap ($2-10 billion), Small-cap ($300 million-$2 billion), Micro-cap ($50-300 million), and Nano-cap (under $50 million). Larger companies tend to be more stable but slower-growing, while smaller companies offer higher growth potential but greater risk."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"Is market cap the same as company value?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"No, market cap only represents the value of a company's equity (shares). Enterprise value provides a more complete picture by including debt, cash, and other factors. Market cap = what you'd pay for all the shares. Enterprise value = what you'd pay to own the entire business, including its debt obligations."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"Why does market cap matter?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Market cap matters because it helps investors assess company size, risk level, and growth potential. It determines index inclusion (like S&P 500), affects stock liquidity and volatility, influences institutional investment eligibility, and helps with portfolio diversification. Larger market caps generally mean lower risk but slower growth, while smaller market caps offer higher growth potential with increased risk."}}],t={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:e};export{t as default,e as mainEntity};
