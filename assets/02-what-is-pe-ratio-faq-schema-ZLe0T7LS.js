const e=[{"@type":"Question",name:"What is P/E ratio?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"The P/E ratio (Price-to-Earnings ratio) measures how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's earnings. It's calculated by dividing the stock price by earnings per share (EPS). For example, if a stock trades at $100 and the company earns $5 per share, the P/E ratio is 20."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"How do you calculate P/E ratio?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"P/E Ratio = Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share (EPS). For example, if a company's stock trades at $150 and it earned $10 per share last year, the P/E ratio is 15 ($150 ÷ $10 = 15)."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"What is a good P/E ratio?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"There's no universal 'good' P/E ratio—it depends on the industry and growth expectations. Generally, a P/E under 15 may indicate an undervalued stock, 15-25 is average, and above 25 suggests high growth expectations or potential overvaluation. Tech companies often have higher P/E ratios (30-50+) due to growth potential, while mature industries like utilities typically have lower P/E ratios (10-15)."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"What does a high P/E ratio mean?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"A high P/E ratio means investors are paying more for each dollar of earnings, typically because they expect strong future growth. It can indicate an expensive or overvalued stock, high growth expectations, or that the company operates in a high-growth industry like technology."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"What does a low P/E ratio mean?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"A low P/E ratio means investors are paying less for each dollar of earnings. This could indicate an undervalued opportunity, concerns about the company's future, a mature or slow-growth industry, or temporary earnings issues. A low P/E requires further investigation to determine if it's a bargain or a warning sign."}}],t={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:e};export{t as default,e as mainEntity};
