const e=`# Netflix Q3 2024 Earnings: What They Actually Said

**Published:** October 17, 2024  
**Company:** Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)  
**Quarter:** Q3 2024 (July - September 2024)

## The 30-Second Version

Netflix keeps proving the doubters wrong. Revenue up 15%. Subscribers up 5.1 million. Earnings crushed expectations. The password sharing crackdown is working. The ad tier is taking off. And remember when everyone said Netflix was dying in 2022? Since that low point, the stock is up over 340%. This quarter, the company guided 2025 revenue to $43-44 billion and made clear their strategy is working. Engagement is healthy at two hours per day per member. The only question now: is the stock overvalued after such a massive run?

## Beat or Miss?

| Metric | Actual | Expected | Result |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Revenue | $9.83B | $9.77B | ✅ Beat |
| EPS | $5.40 | $5.12 | ✅ Beat 5% |
| Subscribers | 282.7M | 282.15M | ✅ Beat |
| Net Adds | +5.1M | — | Strong |

Everything came in above expectations. Free cash flow also surged to $2.19 billion versus $1.89 billion in the year-ago quarter. Netflix raised full-year free cash flow guidance to $6-6.5 billion.

## The Key Trends

### Password Sharing Crackdown: Mission Accomplished

Remember the panic when Netflix announced they'd crack down on password sharing? People said subscribers would flee. Instead, the opposite happened. Paid sharing is now "on the run rate," meaning it's become a normal, predictable revenue stream.

The key insight: Many password borrowers converted to paying subscribers rather than canceling. Netflix added 22 million subscribers in 2023 and is on pace for similar strong adds in 2024. The crackdown turned freeloaders into customers.

### Ad Tier Is Taking Off (But Slowly)

This is the other big bet Netflix made after its 2022 crisis. Here's where it stands:

- Ad tier memberships grew 35% quarter over quarter
- Over 50% of new sign-ups in ad-supported countries choose the ad tier
- Ad revenue expected to roughly double year over year in 2025

But management was careful to manage expectations: "It's still very early for our advertising initiative. We don't expect ads to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2025."

The challenge: Netflix is scaling their ad-supported audience faster than they can sell ads against it. They're building ad tech, hiring sales teams, and adding targeting capabilities. It takes time. They expect ads to become material to revenue in 2026 and beyond.

### Engagement Remains Strong

Two hours per day per paid membership. That's roughly the same level as previous quarters, which might sound disappointing until you realize Netflix's competition has exploded. Disney+, Max, Peacock, Paramount+, Apple TV+... and TikTok, YouTube, video games.

Maintaining engagement in that environment is actually impressive. For owner households specifically (excluding password sharing effects), view hours were up year over year in the first three quarters of 2024.

### Content Slate Recovering from Strikes

The 2023 Hollywood strikes disrupted content pipelines across the industry. Netflix's first half of 2024 was "lumpier" than they'd like. But they're now ramping back to normal.

Q3 hits included: The Perfect Couple, Nobody Wants This, Emily in Paris (return), Cobra Kai (return), Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, Rebel Ridge.

Q4 has heavy hitters: Squid Game Season 2, Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson boxing match, two NFL games on Christmas Day. Plus major releases from Latin America: Senna (Brazil), One Hundred Years of Solitude (Colombia).

## What's the Money Question?

**Can Netflix keep growing now that the "easy" levers (password crackdown, price increases) are largely pulled?**

Management's answer: Yes, through three vectors:

1. **Better content:** The core bet. CEO Ted Sarandos emphasized that over a decade of investment in local content is paying off. Shows from Korea (Squid Game), Japan, India, Thailand, and Latin America are now global hits.

2. **Advertising:** Still early but growing fast. Expect material contribution starting 2026.

3. **New initiatives:** Games, live events, and other expansions. These are small today but could become meaningful over time.

The risk is that Netflix is already at 282 million subscribers. How much bigger can they realistically get? At some point, growth has to slow. The question is when, and whether the stock price already reflects that.

## Management Speak, Translated

> "We had a plan to reaccelerate growth, and we delivered on that plan."
> — Ted Sarandos, Co-CEO

**Translation:** Remember when everyone said we were dead in 2022? Yeah, about that...

> "Engagement on Netflix is healthy: around two hours a day per paid membership on average."
> — Netflix shareholder letter

**Translation:** People still watch a lot of Netflix despite all the competition. We're not losing the attention war.

> "It's still very early for our advertising initiative... we don't expect ads to be a primary driver of our revenue growth in 2025."
> — Netflix shareholder letter

**Translation:** Please don't expect advertising to save the day next year. We're building it right, not fast.

> "Fun fact, if the quarter lasted one more day, net adds would have been up instead of down [in Latin America]."
> — Spencer Neumann, CFO

**Translation:** The slight subscriber decline in Latin America was a timing quirk, not a trend. Don't read too much into it.

> "Our top 10 films that premiere on Netflix all have over 100 million views, among the most-watched films in the world."
> — Ted Sarandos

**Translation:** We don't need theatrical releases to create cultural moments. Netflix IS the theater.

## Jargon Decoder

**Paid Sharing:** Netflix's program where they charge extra for password sharing outside your household. When someone borrows your password, Netflix prompts them to either pay for their own account or pay to be added to yours. This converted a lot of "free" viewers into paying customers.

**Ad Tier:** Netflix's cheaper subscription option that includes ads. It costs about $7/month versus $15+ for ad-free. Netflix makes money both from the subscription AND from selling ads. Initially controversial, now driving over 50% of sign-ups in countries where it's available.

**Average Revenue per Membership (ARM):** How much Netflix makes per subscriber per month. This can grow through price increases, upselling to higher tiers, or adding more members to shared accounts. ARM growth is important because it means Netflix can grow revenue even without adding more subscribers.

**Net Adds:** The number of new subscribers minus cancellations. A positive number means the subscriber base is growing. Q3's 5.1 million net adds is solid, though lower than the massive gains during the password crackdown phase.

## What's Next?

**Q4 2024 Guidance:**
- Revenue: $10.13 billion
- EPS: $4.23
- Operating margin: 22%

**2025 Outlook:**
- Revenue: $43-44 billion (11-13% growth)
- Continued margin improvement (though more gradual than 2024)
- Healthy subscriber growth with focus on better monetization

**Key Events in Q4:**
- November 15: Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson (Netflix's biggest live event yet)
- November 15: New season of Arcane
- December 26: Squid Game Season 2
- December 25: Two NFL games (Christmas Day football)

The Paul vs Tyson fight and NFL games are big tests for Netflix's live streaming capabilities. If they work well, expect more live events. If they have technical issues, it could dampen the strategy.

**Key Dates:**
- January 2025: Q4 2024 earnings
- Starting 2025: Netflix stops reporting quarterly subscriber numbers (they'll still report revenue and other metrics)

## The Bottom Line

Netflix survived its 2022 near-death experience and came back stronger. Password sharing crackdown: working. Ad tier: growing. Content: improving after the strikes. Margins: expanding.

The stock has priced in a lot of this success (up 340% from the May 2022 low). But the business fundamentals genuinely are strong. Engagement is healthy. Free cash flow is surging. And they're still adding millions of subscribers per quarter.

The next chapter is about advertising and live events. Can Netflix become a major ad platform? Can they successfully produce live sports and events? These are the growth drivers that will determine whether the stock goes higher from here.

For now, Netflix has proven that the streaming wars have a clear winner. Everyone else is still trying to figure out how to make money. Netflix already has.
