const e=[{"@type":"Question",name:"What does EBITDA mean?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. It measures a company's operating profitability by looking at earnings before accounting for interest payments on debt, taxes owed to the government, depreciation (the gradual loss of value of physical assets), and amortization (the gradual write-off of intangible assets like patents)."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"Why do companies use EBITDA?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"Companies use EBITDA to compare operational performance across different tax jurisdictions, ignore capital structure differences between debt-heavy and debt-free companies, and focus on actual cash-generating ability rather than accounting conventions. EBITDA strips out financing decisions, tax strategies, and non-cash accounting expenses to reveal core business performance."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"How do you calculate EBITDA?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"EBITDA can be calculated two ways: (1) EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization, or (2) EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization. Most companies report EBITDA in their earnings releases, so you rarely need to calculate it yourself."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"Is EBITDA the same as profit?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"No, EBITDA is not the same as profit. EBITDA excludes interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, while net profit includes all these expenses. EBITDA shows operating cash generation, while net profit shows the actual bottom-line earnings after all expenses are paid."}},{"@type":"Question",name:"What are the limitations of EBITDA?",acceptedAnswer:{"@type":"Answer",text:"EBITDA ignores capital expenditures needed to maintain operations, excludes real cash expenses like interest and taxes, can be manipulated through accounting adjustments, and doesn't account for changes in working capital. Warren Buffett famously criticized EBITDA, noting that depreciation is a real expense that shouldn't be ignored."}}],t={"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage",mainEntity:e};export{t as default,e as mainEntity};
