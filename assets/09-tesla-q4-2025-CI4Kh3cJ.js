## The 30-Second Version

Tesla reports earnings tomorrow, and it's not pretty. The company is on track to report its second consecutive year of declining deliveries and earnings—a stunning reversal for a company that once seemed unstoppable. Deliveries fell 8.6% in 2025, earnings are expected to drop 33%, and margins are under siege from Chinese competitors. Meanwhile, CEO Elon Musk continues to insist that Tesla is actually an AI and robotics company, not a car company. The problem? He's been saying that since 2016, and the robotaxis and humanoid robots remain perpetually "just around the corner." The question isn't whether Tesla will miss—it's whether Musk can still sell the dream.

## What to Expect: The Numbers

| Metric | Expected | Previous (Q4 2024) | What It Means |
|--------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Q4 Revenue | $24.77B | $25.71B | Down 4% year-over-year |
| Q4 EPS | $0.45 | $0.73 | Down 40% year-over-year |
| Q4 Deliveries | 418,227 | 495,570 | Down 16% year-over-year |
| Full Year Revenue | ~$95B | ~$98B | Down 3% year-over-year |
| Full Year EPS | $1.63 | $2.43 | Down 33% year-over-year |
| Full Year Deliveries | 1.636M | 1.789M | Down 8.6% year-over-year |

These aren't just bad numbers. They're historic. Tesla has never reported a full year of declining deliveries. Ever. Not during the 2008 financial crisis. Not during the pandemic. Not when production hell nearly bankrupted the company. This is the first time Tesla is shrinking while the global EV market continues to grow at double-digit rates.

## What's Actually Happening

### The Car Business is Broken

Let's be blunt: Tesla's core business—selling electric vehicles—is in trouble. The company delivered 1.636 million vehicles in 2025, down 8.6% from 2024. That's after deliveries fell 1.1% in 2024. Two consecutive years of decline.

Why is this happening? **China.** Tesla's deliveries in mainland China fell 4.8% in 2025, marking the first-ever annual decline in the world's largest EV market. Chinese competitors like BYD, NIO, and XPeng are eating Tesla's lunch with cheaper vehicles, better software, and faster innovation cycles. BYD officially overtook Tesla as the world's largest EV maker in 2024, and the gap is widening.

But it's not just China. Tesla has been forced to cut prices globally to compete, which is crushing margins. The company's once-industry-leading gross margins are under pressure. Price cuts, incentives, and the loss of US federal tax credits are all squeezing profitability.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: Tesla is losing the price war. Chinese EV makers can produce vehicles cheaper, faster, and increasingly with comparable or better technology. Tesla's manufacturing advantage has evaporated.

### The Margin Death Spiral

Tesla's margins are the canary in the coal mine. For years, Tesla boasted automotive gross margins in the high 20% range—far above traditional automakers. That was the justification for the sky-high valuation. Tesla wasn't just a car company; it was a high-margin tech company that happened to make cars.

Not anymore. Margins have been compressing for eight consecutive quarters. Analysts expect Q4 gross margins to fall below 15%, putting Tesla closer to Ford and GM territory than Apple or Google.

Why? Price cuts. Tesla has slashed prices multiple times to stimulate demand. The Model 3 and Model Y have seen price reductions of 20-30% in some markets. That boosts volume temporarily, but it destroys profitability. And the volume boost isn't even working anymore—deliveries are still falling.

The loss of the $7,500 US federal tax credit for Tesla vehicles (due to battery sourcing rules) is another gut punch. Competitors who still qualify for the credit have a massive pricing advantage.

### Energy Storage: The Only Good News

If there's one bright spot in Tesla's business, it's energy storage. The company deployed a record 14.2 GWh of battery storage in Q4 2025, bringing the full-year total to 46.7 GWh—up 49% year-over-year.

Tesla's Megapack utility-scale batteries are in high demand as utilities and grid operators scramble to add storage capacity for renewable energy. This is a genuinely impressive, high-growth business with strong margins.

The problem? It's not big enough. Energy storage accounts for less than 10% of Tesla's revenue. It's growing fast, but it can't offset the decline in the automotive business, which still drives 80%+ of revenue.

### The Robotaxi Illusion

Here's where things get interesting—or frustrating, depending on your perspective. Musk has spent the last year pivoting Tesla's narrative from "we're a car company" to "we're an AI and robotics company." The thesis: once Tesla solves Full Self-Driving (FSD), the company will operate a massive robotaxi fleet that generates recurring, high-margin revenue.

The problem? Musk has been promising this since 2016. He said Tesla would have a million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Then 2021. Then 2022. Now it's 2026, and Tesla is running a tiny pilot program in Austin with a handful of cars.

As of January 2026, Tesla operates maybe a few dozen robotaxis in Austin—all with safety monitors. That's it. No other cities. No scale. No revenue to speak of. Meanwhile, Waymo (owned by Google's parent Alphabet) is operating tens of thousands of fully autonomous rides per week across multiple cities with no safety drivers.

Musk's strategy is clear: keep the robotaxi dream alive to justify Tesla's valuation, even as the core business deteriorates. During the Q4 earnings call, expect him to talk extensively about FSD improvements, the upcoming "Cybercab" robotaxi vehicle, and how Tesla is "on the verge" of unsupervised autonomy.

Don't hold your breath. Tesla has been "on the verge" for a decade.

### Optimus: The Other Distraction

Musk also loves to talk about Optimus, Tesla's humanoid robot. He's claimed that Optimus will eventually be worth more than the entire car business. In 2025, he said Tesla would have 5,000 to 10,000 Optimus robots deployed in its factories.

The reality? Maybe a few dozen prototypes doing simple tasks. There's no mass production. No commercial deployment. No revenue. Just more promises.

To be fair, humanoid robots are genuinely hard to build. But Musk's habit of making wildly optimistic predictions and then missing them by years erodes credibility.

## The Big Question

**Is Tesla still a growth company, or is it becoming a mature automaker?**

**The bull case:** This is temporary. Tesla is in a transition period. Once the next-generation cheaper vehicle launches (rumored for late 2026 or 2027), demand will surge. FSD will eventually work, unlocking the robotaxi business. Optimus will revolutionize manufacturing. Energy storage will become a massive revenue driver. The stock is cheap relative to Tesla's long-term potential.

**The bear case:** Tesla is losing the EV race. Chinese competitors are better, faster, and cheaper. The robotaxi timeline has been pushed back so many times that it's no longer credible. Optimus is vaporware. Energy storage is nice but not big enough. Tesla is becoming a normal car company with normal margins, which means the stock should trade like Ford or GM, not like a tech company. The current valuation is insane.

**What to listen for tomorrow:** Does Musk provide a concrete timeline for the next-generation vehicle? Does he admit that margins will stay compressed, or does he promise a rebound? Does he provide any real evidence of robotaxi progress, or is it more hand-waving? And most importantly: does he sound confident, or defensive?

## What Management Will Probably Say

Based on Tesla's history and recent patterns, expect:

**On deliveries:** "We faced headwinds from the transition to next-generation products and a challenging macroeconomic environment. Demand for our vehicles remains strong." (Translation: We're losing market share but don't want to admit it.)

**On margins:** "We remain focused on cost reduction and operational efficiency. As we scale our next-generation platform, margins will improve." (Translation: Margins are bad now, but trust us, they'll get better eventually.)

**On FSD/Robotaxi:** "We're making tremendous progress on Full Self-Driving. We expect to achieve unsupervised FSD by the end of 2026 and begin scaling our robotaxi network shortly after." (Translation: Same thing we've been saying for years. Maybe this time it's true?)

**On Optimus:** "Optimus is progressing faster than expected. We're on track to deploy thousands of units in 2026." (Translation: We have a few prototypes. Thousands is aspirational.)

**On energy storage:** "Energy storage had a record quarter and is becoming a significant contributor to our business." (Translation: This is actually true and the only unambiguously good news.)

## Jargon, Explained

**Deliveries vs. Sales:** Tesla reports "deliveries," which are vehicles handed over to customers. This is slightly different from "sales," which can include vehicles sold to dealers or fleet customers. For Tesla, deliveries are essentially the same as sales since Tesla doesn't use dealers.

**Gross Margin:** Revenue minus the direct cost of producing vehicles, divided by revenue. This shows how much profit Tesla makes on each car before paying for overhead, R&D, and other expenses. Tesla's gross margins used to be in the high 20% range (amazing for a car company), but they've been falling due to price cuts.

**Operating Margin:** Operating profit divided by revenue. This includes all costs except interest and taxes. It's a more complete picture of profitability than gross margin. Tesla's operating margin has been compressing as the company spends heavily on R&D for FSD and Optimus while revenue growth stalls.

**Full Self-Driving (FSD):** Tesla's advanced driver assistance system. Despite the name, it's not actually "full self-driving"—it requires constant human supervision. Tesla charges $8,000-$15,000 for FSD, or $99/month for a subscription. Musk has been promising true unsupervised autonomy for years, but it hasn't materialized.

**Robotaxi:** Tesla's planned autonomous ride-hailing service. The idea is that Tesla owners could add their cars to a fleet when not using them, earning passive income. Tesla would also operate its own fleet of purpose-built robotaxis (the "Cybercab"). This is the core of Musk's thesis that Tesla is worth trillions of dollars. The problem is that it doesn't exist yet beyond a tiny pilot program.

**Optimus:** Tesla's humanoid robot project. Musk claims it will eventually be worth more than the car business. As of January 2026, it's mostly prototypes and demos. No mass production, no commercial deployment, no revenue.

**Energy Storage / Megapack:** Tesla's utility-scale battery storage systems. Utilities and grid operators buy Megapacks to store renewable energy and stabilize the grid. This is Tesla's fastest-growing and most profitable business segment, but it's still small compared to automotive.

**BYD:** Chinese EV and battery maker that overtook Tesla as the world's largest EV manufacturer in 2024. BYD is vertically integrated (makes its own batteries and chips), has lower costs than Tesla, and is expanding globally. BYD is Tesla's biggest competitive threat.

## The Bottom Line

Tesla reports earnings tomorrow, and the numbers will be ugly. Second consecutive year of declining deliveries. Earnings down 33%. Margins compressing. The core automotive business is under siege from Chinese competitors who are faster, cheaper, and increasingly better.

Elon Musk will try to shift the conversation to robotaxis, Optimus robots, and energy storage. He'll paint a picture of a future where Tesla is worth trillions because of AI and autonomy. He's been painting that picture for a decade, and it hasn't materialized.

The question for investors: Do you believe the dream, or do you believe the numbers?

If you think Tesla will solve Full Self-Driving in the next 1-2 years and deploy a massive robotaxi fleet, the stock is cheap. If you think Tesla is becoming a normal car company with normal margins, the stock is wildly overvalued.

Watch for three things tomorrow: (1) Any concrete timeline for the next-generation cheaper vehicle, (2) Real evidence of robotaxi progress beyond vague promises, and (3) Whether Musk sounds confident or defensive when pressed on the delivery decline.

This isn't just another earnings report. It's a referendum on whether Tesla is still a growth company or a mature automaker in decline.
