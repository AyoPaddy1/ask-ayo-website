## Purpose
This template ensures every earnings article follows the same structure, voice, and format. Use this as the blueprint for all earnings coverage.

## Article Structure (MANDATORY)

### 1. Title (H1)
Format: `[Company] [Quarter] [Fiscal Year] Earnings: [Punchy Headline]`

Examples:
- "Apple Q1 FY2026 Earnings: $143.8B Revenue Smashes Records"
- "Tesla Q4 2025 Earnings: First Annual Revenue Decline, But Margins Improve"
- "Google Q4 2025 Earnings: [Your Headline Here]"

### 2. Opening Paragraph (The Hook)
- Lead with the **biggest number** or **most surprising result**
- Include key metrics: revenue, EPS, year-over-year change
- State whether they beat/missed expectations
- End with a transition sentence

**Template:**
```
[Company] just reported [Quarter] [Year] earnings, and [one-sentence summary of results]. Revenue was **$X billion** ([up/down] X% year-over-year), and earnings per share came in at **$X.XX** ([up/down] X%). [Beat/missed] what analysts were expecting.

[One sentence about what stood out or what's interesting].
```

### 3. Section 2: "The Numbers" (H2)
- Bullet points with key metrics
- Revenue (actual vs expected)
- EPS (GAAP and/or Non-GAAP)
- Any other critical top-line numbers
- 1-2 paragraphs explaining what the numbers mean in plain English

**Template:**
```
## The Numbers: [Descriptive Subtitle]

- **Revenue:** $X.XB ([up/down] X% year-over-year)
- **EPS:** $X.XX ([beat/missed] the $X.XX analysts expected)
- **[Other key metric]:** [Number and context]

[2-3 sentences explaining what these numbers actually mean and why they matter]
```

### 4. Section 3: Business Segment Breakdown (H2)
- One H2 section per major business segment (e.g., "iPhone Sales Go Absolutely Mental", "Automotive: Fewer Cars, Better Margins")
- Lead with the **result** (up/down, good/bad)
- Explain **why** it happened (3-5 bullet points or short paragraphs)
- Include specific numbers and percentages

**Template:**
```
## [Business Segment]: [Punchy Subtitle]

[Business segment] revenue was **$X.X billion**, [up/down] X% year-over-year. [One sentence on whether this is good/bad/expected].

Why [the result]?
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]
- [Reason 3]

[1-2 sentences of additional context or implications]
```

Repeat for each major segment (usually 2-4 segments).

### 5. Section 4: "What's Coming Next" or "What [Company] Said About [Next Period]" (H2)
- Forward-looking guidance from the company
- New products, initiatives, or strategic shifts
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Translate corporate speak into plain English

**Template:**
```
## What's Coming in [Year/Quarter]: [Brief Description]

[Company] gave some guidance on what's next:

- **[Product/Initiative 1]:** [Status and timeline]
- **[Product/Initiative 2]:** [Status and timeline]

[1-2 sentences on what this means or why it matters]
```

### 6. Section 5: "The Bottom Line for Investors" (H2)
- Summary of what the results mean
- No stock price predictions or market reaction language
- Focus on the **business fundamentals**
- End with the key question or thing to watch

**Template:**
```
## The Bottom Line for Investors

## Voice & Style Rules

### DO:
- **Write like a human.** Conversational, direct, no jargon
- **Use bold** for key numbers and important terms
- **Be specific.** "$85.3 billion" not "strong iPhone sales"
- **Explain why.** Don't just report numbers—tell readers what they mean
- **Use active voice.** "Apple beat expectations" not "Expectations were beaten by Apple"
- **Break down corporate speak.** Translate earnings call language into plain English

### DON'T:
- ❌ **NO stock market reaction language.** No "stock fell 3%", "investors nervous", "shares rallied"
- ❌ **NO predictions.** No "the stock will likely...", "investors should..."
- ❌ **NO fluff.** Get to the point quickly
- ❌ **NO bullet point overload.** Use bullets strategically, not as a crutch
- ❌ **NO jargon without explanation.** If you use "GAAP" or "gross margin", explain it

### Tone Examples:
✅ "iPhone revenue was $85.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year. That's the highest iPhone revenue Apple has ever reported in a single quarter."

❌ "iPhone revenue exceeded expectations, demonstrating strong consumer demand and robust market positioning."

✅ "Translation: Tesla is making more profit on each car it sells, even though it's selling fewer cars overall."

❌ "Tesla's automotive gross margin improved from 15.4% to 17.9%, indicating enhanced operational efficiency."

## Formatting Rules

### Headers:
- H1: Article title only
- H2: Major sections
- No H3s (keep it simple)

### Numbers:
- Use **bold** for all key financial figures
- Format large numbers: "$143.8 billion" or "$143.8B" (be consistent within article)
- Always include year-over-year comparison: "(up 16%)" or "(down 3% year-over-year)"

### Lists:
- Use bullet points for reasons, guidance, or multiple related items
- Keep bullets short (1-2 lines max)
- Use dashes (not asterisks) for bullets in markdown: `- Item`

### Emphasis:
- **Bold** for numbers, key terms, and important phrases
- *Italics* sparingly (almost never needed)
- No ALL CAPS except in acronyms (EPS, GAAP, etc.)
