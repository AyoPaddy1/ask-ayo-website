# Disney Q1 FY2026: Parks Hit Record Revenue, Streaming Finally Profitable

Disney just posted **$26.0 billion** in revenue for Q1 FY2026, up 5% year-over-year. The headline story: **Experiences (theme parks and resorts) hit a record $10.0 billion in quarterly revenue**, and **streaming turned profitable** with $450 million in operating income.

But the stock reaction was muted—Disney shares were up just 1% after hours—because investors were hoping for stronger guidance. Disney said FY2026 will see "double digit segment OI growth" and "double digit adjusted EPS growth," but didn't give specific numbers.

This is classic Disney: solid results, but the market wanted more.

## The Numbers

- **Revenue:** $26.0 billion (+5% YoY from $24.7B)
- **EPS (GAAP):** $1.34 (down from $1.40 last year)
- **EPS (Adjusted):** $1.63 (down from $1.76 last year)
- **Total segment operating income:** $4.6 billion (-9% from $5.1B)

The revenue beat was solid, but operating income fell 9% because of higher programming costs (Entertainment segment) and pre-launch costs for new attractions (Experiences segment).

## Experiences: $10 Billion in Quarterly Revenue (A Record)

Disney's theme parks and resorts business just had its best quarter ever. **$10.0 billion in revenue** and **$3.3 billion in operating income**.

Here's the breakdown:
- **Domestic parks (Disney World, Disneyland):** Operating income grew 8%, attendance up 1%, per capita spending up 4%
- **International parks:** Modest growth, but headwinds from pre-opening costs for new attractions (Disney Adventure at Disney Cruise Line, World of Frozen at Disneyland Paris)

The key takeaway: **People are still spending at Disney parks**. Attendance was only up 1%, but per capita spending (how much each guest spends on tickets, food, merch) was up 4%. That's pricing power.

Disney is also investing heavily in new attractions. The **Disney Adventure cruise ship** launches soon, and **World of Frozen** opens at Disneyland Paris this year. These are expensive upfront but will drive long-term growth.

## Streaming Is Finally Profitable

Disney's streaming business (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+) posted **$450 million in operating income** with an **8.4% operating margin**. That's up $189 million year-over-year.

This is a huge milestone. For years, Disney was losing billions on streaming as it built out Disney+ to compete with Netflix. Now it's profitable.

Revenue grew **11% year-over-year** (adjusting for the Star India impact in the prior year). The growth came from:
- **Higher subscription fees** (Disney+ raised prices in late 2025)
- **More subscribers** (Disney didn't disclose exact numbers, but implied growth)
- **Better cost discipline** (less spending on content that doesn't drive engagement)

Disney's streaming strategy is working: raise prices, focus on quality content (not quantity), and let profitability grow. It's the opposite of what they did in 2020-2023 when they were chasing Netflix's subscriber count at any cost.

## Entertainment Segment: Higher Costs, But Still Growing

The **Entertainment segment** (movies, TV, streaming content) posted **$1.1 billion in operating income** with a **9.5% margin**. Revenue grew 7% year-over-year, driven by:
- **Higher theatrical revenue** (Disney had a strong slate in Q1, including *Mufasa: The Lion King*)
- **Higher subscription and affiliate fees** (cable networks like ABC, Disney Channel)
- **Higher programming and production costs** (offset some of the gains)

The margin of 9.5% is solid but not spectacular. Disney is spending heavily on content to feed Disney+, Hulu, and its cable networks. That's the trade-off: invest in content now to drive long-term streaming growth.

## Sports (ESPN): The YouTube TV Problem

ESPN posted **$191 million in operating income**, down $56 million year-over-year. Why? **YouTube TV temporarily suspended ESPN's carriage**, costing Disney about **$110 million** in lost revenue.

This is a big deal. YouTube TV is one of the largest streaming TV providers in the US, and losing carriage (even temporarily) hurts ESPN's subscriber and advertising revenue.

The good news: ESPN's advertising revenue grew 10%, showing that live sports advertising is still strong. The bad news: subscription and affiliate fees fell, reflecting the ongoing decline of cable TV.

Disney is betting big on **ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming service** (launching in 2026), which will let fans subscribe directly to ESPN without a cable bundle. That's the future of sports media, but it's not here yet.

## What Disney Said About the Future

Disney's guidance for FY2026 (full year):
- **Entertainment segment:** "Double digit segment OI growth" (weighted to second half of the year)
- **SVOD (streaming):** Operating margin of 10%
- **Sports (ESPN):** "Low-single digit segment OI growth"
- **Experiences (parks):** "High-single digit growth in segment OI" (weighted to second half)
- **Adjusted EPS:** "Double digit growth"
- **Cash from operations:** $19 billion

Translation: Disney expects the second half of FY2026 to be much stronger than the first half. That's typical for Disney—theme parks are busier in summer, and the holiday movie slate drives Q4 revenue.

But investors wanted more specific numbers. "Double digit growth" could mean 10% or 99%. Disney didn't commit to a range, which left some uncertainty.

## The Bottom Line

Disney's Q1 was solid but not spectacular:
- **Parks hit a record $10B in quarterly revenue** (pricing power intact)
- **Streaming turned profitable** ($450M operating income, 8.4% margin)
- **Entertainment segment growing** but margins compressed by higher content costs
- **ESPN hurt by YouTube TV suspension** (cost $110M)

The stock was up 1% after hours because the results were good but not great. Disney delivered on the fundamentals (parks are strong, streaming is profitable), but the guidance was vague ("double digit growth" without specifics).

The big question for 2026: Can Disney maintain pricing power at its parks while also growing attendance? And can streaming margins expand to 10% as promised?

If yes, Disney's stock will keep climbing. If not, expect more muted reactions like today.
