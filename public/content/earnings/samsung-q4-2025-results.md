# Samsung Q4 2025: Memory Chips Just Saved the Year

Samsung just posted its best quarter in years, and it's all thanks to the AI boom. Operating profit more than tripled year-over-year, driven entirely by memory chips—the DRAM and NAND that power AI data centers.

## The Numbers

- **Revenue:** 93.8 trillion KRW (~$70B USD), up 24% YoY
- **Operating profit:** 20.1 trillion KRW (~$15B USD), up 209% YoY
- **Net profit:** 19.6 trillion KRW (~$14.7B USD), up 151% YoY
- **EPS:** 2,909 KRW per share

For context, Samsung's operating profit more than tripled in a single year. That's the kind of turnaround you get when you're selling the exact chips everyone needs for AI.

## The Memory Chip Boom

Samsung's memory division—which makes DRAM and NAND chips—brought in 37.1 trillion KRW in Q4, up 62% year-over-year. That's a record quarter.

Why the explosion? AI data centers need massive amounts of memory. Specifically, they need **HBM (high-bandwidth memory)**—specialized DRAM that sits right next to Nvidia's AI chips—and **server DDR5**, the standard memory for AI servers.

Samsung has been playing catch-up to SK Hynix in HBM, but Q4 showed they're closing the gap. They're ramping up production of HBM4 (the next generation) and expect the AI boom to keep driving demand through 2026.

## The Smartphone Problem

While memory chips are booming, Samsung's smartphone business is struggling. The **Device Experience division** (phones, TVs, appliances) grew revenue by 9% to 44.3 trillion KRW, but operating profit fell 43% to just 1.3 trillion KRW.

Translation: Samsung is selling more phones, but making way less money on each one. Competition from Chinese brands (especially in mid-range phones) is squeezing margins hard.

## What's Next

Samsung's guidance for 2026 is all about AI:
- **HBM4 mass production** starting in Q1 2026, including an industry-leading 11.7Gbps version
- **Expand AI-related products**: more DDR5, SOCAMM2, GDDR7, and high-performance SSDs for AI workloads
- **Lead the AI era** by partnering closely with customers (read: Nvidia, AMD, and the big cloud providers)

For full-year 2025, Samsung posted 333.6 trillion KRW in revenue (up 11%) and 43.6 trillion KRW in operating profit (up 33%). After a rough 2023 and early 2024, this was Samsung's turnaround year.

## The Bottom Line

Samsung's Q4 was a blowout, but it's a tale of two businesses. Memory chips are printing money thanks to AI, while smartphones are barely profitable. The company is betting big on HBM and AI-related memory products to carry them through 2026.

If the AI boom continues, Samsung's memory division will keep thriving. If it slows down, the smartphone problem becomes a much bigger issue.
