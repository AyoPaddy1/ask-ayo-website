# Tesla Q4 2025 Earnings: First Annual Revenue Decline, But Margins Improve

Tesla just reported Q4 2025 earnings, and it's a mixed bag. Revenue was **$24.9 billion** (down 3% year-over-year), marking Tesla's **first annual revenue decline ever**. But earnings per share beat expectations, and automotive gross margins improved.

Here's what's going on.

## The Numbers: Revenue Down, But Profits Beat

- **Revenue:** $24.9B (down 3% year-over-year)
- **GAAP EPS:** $0.24
- **Non-GAAP EPS:** $0.50 (beat the $0.45 analysts expected)

Tesla's revenue dropped for the first time in its history as a public company. The main culprit? **Automotive revenue fell 11%** to $17.7 billion. Tesla sold fewer cars in 2025 than in 2024, and that hit the top line hard.

But the non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 beat expectations, which is why the stock didn't completely tank. Investors care more about profitability than revenue, and Tesla is still making money.

## Automotive: Fewer Cars, Better Margins

Tesla's automotive business had a rough year. Revenue was down 11%, but **automotive gross margin improved from 15.4% to 17.9%**. That's a big jump.

Translation: Tesla is making more profit on each car it sells, even though it's selling fewer cars overall.

Why the margin improvement?
- Cost cuts (Tesla has been slashing expenses all year)
- Better production efficiency
- Higher average selling prices (fewer discounts than in 2024)

But the volume problem is real. Tesla delivered **1.64 million cars in 2025**, down from 1.81 million in 2024. That's a 9% drop. The EV market is getting more competitive, and Tesla's market share is shrinking.

## Energy: The Bright Spot

While automotive struggled, **Tesla's energy business had a record year**. Energy revenue (solar panels, Powerwalls, Megapacks) hit **$3.06 billion in Q4**, up significantly from last year.

For the full year, energy revenue was around **$12.8 billion**, growing fast. This is becoming a real business for Tesla, not just a side project.

The Megapack (Tesla's utility-scale battery) is in high demand, and Tesla is building a new Megapack factory to keep up. This could be a major growth driver in 2026.

## What's Coming in 2026: Cybercab, Semi, Optimus

Tesla gave some guidance on what's next:

- **Cybercab (robotaxi):** On track for volume production in 2026
- **Tesla Semi:** Ramping up production in 2026
- **Megapack 3:** New factory coming online
- **Optimus (humanoid robot):** Gen 3 unveiling in ~3 months, targeting 1 million units/year production by end of 2026
- **Model S and Model X:** Being wound down (production space will be converted to Optimus factory)

Tesla is also investing **$2 billion in xAI** (Elon's AI company). That raised some eyebrows — investors are wondering if Tesla should be spending money on Elon's other ventures instead of its own products.

## The Big Bet: Autonomy and Robotics

Tesla is shifting away from being a car company and toward being an **autonomy and robotics company**. The Cybercab (robotaxi) and Optimus (robot) are the future, according to Elon.

The problem? Neither of those products is generating meaningful revenue yet. And Tesla's core car business is shrinking.

Investors are split:
- **Bulls** think Tesla is positioning itself for the next era of tech (self-driving cars and robots)
- **Bears** think Tesla is losing focus and burning cash on unproven bets

## The Bottom Line for Investors

Tesla's first annual revenue decline is a big deal. The car business is struggling, and competition is heating up.

But margins are improving, energy is growing fast, and Tesla is betting big on autonomy and robotics. If those bets pay off, Tesla could dominate the next decade. If they don't, Tesla will be a shrinking car company with a lot of expensive side projects.

The stock reaction was muted — down slightly after earnings. Investors are waiting to see if Tesla can actually deliver on its 2026 promises (Cybercab, Optimus, Semi).

For now, Tesla is in transition. The question is: transition to what?
