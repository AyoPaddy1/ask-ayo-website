# LVMH 2025: Revenue Down 5%, But Margins Tell a Different Story

LVMH just reported **€80.8 billion** in revenue for 2025, down 5% from 2024. That's the headline. But here's what actually matters: **operating margin stayed at 22%** and **free cash flow grew 8%** to €11.3 billion.

Translation: LVMH took a revenue hit from the luxury slowdown but protected profitability. That's how you manage a downturn.

## The Numbers

- **Revenue:** €80.8 billion (-5% reported, -1% organic)
- **Operating profit:** €17.8 billion (-9%)
- **Net profit:** €10.9 billion (-13%)
- **Free cash flow:** €11.3 billion (+8%)
- **Operating margin:** 22% (unchanged)

The revenue decline looks bad until you break it down:
- **-3% from currency** (strong euro hurt conversions)
- **-1% organic decline** (actual business slowdown)

So the real drop was just 1% in constant currency terms. Not great, but not a collapse.

## Fashion & Leather Goods: Still Absurdly Profitable

This is Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Celine—the handbag and luxury fashion brands that print money.

- **Revenue:** €37.8 billion (-8% reported, -5% organic)
- **Operating profit:** €13.2 billion (-13%)
- **Operating margin:** 35%

Let that sink in: Even in a slowdown, LVMH's fashion division makes **35 cents of operating profit on every euro of sales**. That's insane. Most retailers are happy with 10%.

The slowdown hit hard (revenue down 5% organically), but the margin stayed sky-high because LVMH cut costs and protected pricing. They didn't discount to chase volume.

## Sephora Keeps Growing

While luxury fashion slowed, **Selective Retailing** (mostly Sephora) grew **4% organically**.

- **Revenue:** €18.3 billion (flat reported, +4% organic)

Why? Beauty is more resilient than $5,000 handbags. When people tighten budgets, they still buy lipstick. They don't buy another Birkin.

Sephora is now LVMH's second-biggest division by revenue and it's still growing. Bernard Arnault (LVMH's CEO and richest man in Europe) loves this business because it's consistent.

## China Came Back in the Second Half

LVMH said "the rest of Asia saw a noticeable improvement in trends with respect to 2024, with a return to growth in the second half of the year."

Translation: **China started buying again** after the government stimulus kicked in. That's huge because China is LVMH's biggest growth market.

The bad news: **Japan was down** because the yen strengthened (fewer tourists buying Louis Vuitton bags in Tokyo). **Europe declined in H2** (economic weakness). **US grew** but not enough to offset the rest.

## What About the Other Divisions?

**Watches & Jewelry** (Tiffany, TAG Heuer, Bulgari):
- Revenue: €10.5 billion (-1% reported, **+3% organic**)
- Tiffany's renovated stores are working. The brand is back.

**Perfumes & Cosmetics** (Dior Beauty, Givenchy, Guerlain):
- Revenue: €8.2 billion (-3% reported, **flat organic**)
- Holding steady despite luxury slowdown.

**Wines & Spirits** (Moët, Hennessy, Dom Pérignon):
- Revenue: €5.4 billion (-9% reported, **-5% organic**)
- Cognac demand is weak (Hennessy struggling). Champagne held up better.

## The Free Cash Flow Story

Here's the most impressive number: **Free cash flow grew 8%** to €11.3 billion despite revenue falling 5%.

How? LVMH cut costs, managed inventory tightly, and collected cash faster. This is what separates great businesses from good ones—they generate more cash in a downturn by getting more efficient.

LVMH also paid down debt. **Net financial debt fell 26%** to €6.9 billion. The balance sheet is rock-solid.

## What Bernard Arnault Said

"Once again in 2025, LVMH demonstrated its solidity and effective strategy upheld by its highly engaged teams. The Group was buoyed by the loyalty and growing demand shown by our local customers."

Translation: "We're fine. Local customers (not tourists) kept buying. We're managing through this."

He also highlighted:
- **The Louis** (new luxury hotel in Shanghai)
- **House of Dior** store openings
- **Tiffany** renovations in Milan and Tokyo
- **World Expo in Osaka** (showcasing French craftsmanship)
- **Formula 1 partnership** (10-year deal, first year done)

Arnault is playing the long game. He's investing in stores, experiences, and brand-building while competitors cut back.

## The Bottom Line

LVMH's revenue fell 5% in 2025, but the business is stronger than the headline suggests:
- **Margins held at 22%** (cost discipline)
- **Free cash flow grew 8%** (operational excellence)
- **China returned to growth in H2** (stimulus working)
- **Sephora keeps growing** (beauty is resilient)
- **Fashion & Leather Goods still at 35% margin** (pricing power intact)

This is what a well-managed luxury business looks like in a slowdown. LVMH didn't panic, didn't discount, and didn't sacrifice long-term brand value for short-term sales.

The question for 2026: Will China's recovery continue? If yes, LVMH will be fine. If China stalls again, expect another year of flat-to-down revenue. But even then, margins and cash flow will probably hold up.
