# Google Q4 2025 Earnings Preview: Can Cloud Growth Justify the $4 Trillion Valuation?

Google (Alphabet) reports Q4 2025 earnings **Tuesday, February 4** after market close. Wall Street expects **$111.2 billion in revenue** (up 16% year-over-year) and **$2.64 adjusted EPS** (up 23%).

The stock is up **66% over the past year** and recently crossed a **$4 trillion market cap**. Now investors want to know: Can Google justify that valuation with continued growth in Cloud and AI?

Here's what to watch when Google reports.

## The Expectations

**Revenue:** $111.2 billion (up 16% from $95.9B in Q4 2024)  
**Adjusted EPS:** $2.64 (up 23% from $2.15 in Q4 2024)  
**Google Cloud revenue:** $12.5-13B (up 30%+ year-over-year)  
**YouTube ad revenue:** $11.82B (up 12.9%)  
**Total Google advertising revenue:** $80.97B (up 11.8%)

If Google hits these numbers, it will mark another strong quarter of double-digit revenue growth. The question is whether that's enough to keep the stock climbing after a 66% run-up.

## What to Watch: Google Cloud

**Google Cloud** is the story everyone's watching. Analysts expect **$12.5-13 billion in revenue** (up 30%+ year-over-year), making it Google's fastest-growing segment.

Why it matters: Google Cloud is Google's AI growth engine. Businesses are paying Google to use its AI models (Gemini, Vertex AI) and infrastructure to build AI applications. If Cloud growth stays above 30%, it signals that Google is winning the AI infrastructure race against Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure).

The risk: **Capital expenditures (capex)**. Google is spending billions on data centers and AI chips (TPUs) to support Cloud growth. If capex keeps rising without a corresponding increase in Cloud revenue, investors will worry about returns on investment.

Meta just guided to **$115-135 billion in capex** for 2026, spooking investors. If Google announces similar AI spending increases, expect the stock to react negatively—even if Cloud growth is strong.

## What to Watch: Search and YouTube Ads

**Google Search** is still Google's cash cow, generating over $50 billion per quarter in ad revenue. Analysts expect **13%+ growth** in Q4, driven by:
- **AI Overviews** (Google's new AI-powered search results) starting to show ads
- Strong holiday shopping season (Q4 is always Google's biggest ad quarter)
- Continued market share dominance (Google has 90%+ of global search traffic)

**YouTube** is expected to post **$11.82 billion in ad revenue** (up 12.9%). That's solid but not spectacular. The question is whether YouTube's growth is accelerating or plateauing.

The risk: **AI search competition**. ChatGPT Search (from OpenAI) and Perplexity AI are starting to pull users away from Google Search. If Google's Search growth slows below 10%, it's a red flag that AI-powered search engines are eating into Google's core business.

## What to Watch: AI Monetization

Google has been talking about AI for years, but investors want to see **proof of monetization**. Specifically:
- **How much revenue is Gemini (Google's AI model) generating?**
- **How many businesses are paying for Google AI services?**
- **What's the margin on AI products?**

Google hasn't disclosed these numbers in past quarters, but with the stock at a $4 trillion valuation, investors are demanding more transparency. If Google announces AI-specific revenue figures (like Microsoft did with Azure AI), expect the stock to rally.

If Google stays vague about AI monetization, expect skepticism.

## What to Watch: Capex and 2026 Guidance

The biggest wildcard is **2026 guidance**. Meta just guided to **$115-135 billion in capex** for 2026, and the stock dropped 8% because investors worried about profitability.

If Google announces a similar capex increase (analysts expect $60-70 billion for 2026, up from ~$50 billion in 2025), the stock could sell off—even if Q4 results are strong.

The bull case: Google is investing in AI infrastructure now to dominate the next decade of cloud computing. The capex will pay off in higher Cloud revenue and margins.

The bear case: Google is overspending on AI without a clear path to profitability. If Cloud growth slows or margins compress, all that capex will look wasteful.

## The Bull Case

**Why Google could beat expectations:**
- **Google Cloud growth accelerates above 30%** (driven by AI demand)
- **Search ad revenue beats estimates** (AI Overviews driving more ad clicks)
- **YouTube growth reaccelerates** (Shorts monetization improving)
- **Google announces AI-specific revenue** (proves AI is monetizing, not just a cost center)
- **Capex guidance is moderate** (investors don't panic about overspending)

If Google delivers on all of these, the stock could rally 5-10% and push toward $200 per share.

## The Bear Case

**Why Google could disappoint:**
- **Google Cloud growth slows below 30%** (AI demand isn't as strong as expected)
- **Search ad revenue misses estimates** (AI search competition is hurting Google)
- **YouTube growth decelerates** (Shorts aren't monetizing well)
- **Google stays vague about AI monetization** (no proof that AI is generating revenue)
- **Capex guidance spikes** (Google announces $80-100B in AI spending for 2026)

If Google disappoints on any of these, the stock could drop 5-10%, especially after a 66% run-up over the past year.

## The Bottom Line

Google's Q4 earnings will answer one question: **Can the company justify its $4 trillion valuation with continued growth in Cloud and AI?**

If Google Cloud stays above 30% growth and Google proves that AI is monetizing (not just costing money), the stock will keep climbing.

If Cloud growth slows or capex spikes without clear returns, expect investors to take profits after a massive 66% rally.

**Watch for:**
- Google Cloud revenue and growth rate (target: 30%+)
- Search ad revenue growth (target: 13%+)
- AI monetization details (revenue, customers, margins)
- 2026 capex guidance (risk: $70B+)
