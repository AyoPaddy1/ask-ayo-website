Google’s parent company, Alphabet, just reported its Q4 2025 earnings, capping off its biggest year ever with over **$400 billion** in annual revenue for the first time [1]. Revenue for the quarter was **$113.83 billion** (up 18% year-over-year), and earnings per share came in at **$2.82**, both beating what analysts were expecting [2].

The real story, however, is the money they're about to spend. Google announced plans to nearly double its spending in 2026 to accelerate its push into artificial intelligence [3].

### The Numbers: Record Revenue, Strong Profits

- **Revenue:** $113.83 billion (up 18% year-over-year)
- **Net Income:** $34.46 billion (up 30% year-over-year)
- **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** $2.82 (beat the $2.63 analysts expected)

Here’s how the quarter compares to the same period last year:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q4 2024 | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Total Revenue** | $113.83 billion | $96.5 billion | +18% |
| **Net Income** | $34.46 billion | $26.54 billion | +30% |
| **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** | $2.82 | $2.15 | +31% |

### Search: Still the Cash Cow

Despite fears of AI disruption, Google's Search business is stronger than ever. Revenue from Search and other advertising hit roughly **$70.9 billion** for the quarter, a 17% jump from last year [4]. The company noted that its AI-powered search features are leading to longer, more complex user queries, suggesting higher engagement [4].

### Cloud: The Growth Engine

Google Cloud was the standout performer. Its revenue shot up **48%** to **$17.7 billion** as more companies adopt Google’s AI tools [2]. The demand is so high that Google Cloud now has a backlog of contracts worth a staggering **$240 billion** [4]. This shows that the company's big investments in enterprise AI are paying off.

### YouTube: A Slight Miss

YouTube’s ad revenue grew **9%** to **$11.4 billion**, which was a little shy of what analysts had penciled in [2]. The company explained this was a tough comparison to the end of 2024, which was flooded with political ad spending during the U.S. elections [2].

### What's Coming in 2026: The AI Spending Spree

Google announced it expects to spend between **$175 billion and $185 billion** on capital expenditures in 2026, nearly double its 2025 spend [3].

> “We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board,” said CEO Sundar Pichai. “To meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities ahead of us, our 2026 CapEx investments are anticipated to be in the range of $175 to $185 billion.” [4]

Translation: Google is building the infrastructure—data centers, custom chips (TPUs), and more—to power the next decade of AI, and it's not afraid to spend big to do it.

### The Bottom Line for Investors

This was a blowout quarter for Google. The core Search business is accelerating, the Cloud business is exploding, and the company is more profitable than ever. The massive increase in spending shows a company that is aggressively investing from a position of strength to cement its leadership in AI.

The key question for the next year is how quickly these huge AI investments will translate into new products and even faster growth. For now, Google is sending a clear message: the future is AI, and they’re building it, no matter the cost.
