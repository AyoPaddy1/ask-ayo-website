### The Short of It

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, just wrapped up its biggest year ever, pulling in over $400 billion in revenue for the first time [1]. In the last three months of 2025, they beat Wall Street's expectations, with their core Search and Cloud businesses growing faster than anyone predicted [2].

The real story, though, isn't just the record-breaking numbers. It's the money they're about to spend. Google announced plans to nearly double its spending in 2026 to build out its artificial intelligence capabilities [3]. It’s a Texas-sized bet on the future of AI.

### The Numbers

Here’s how Alphabet’s Q4 2025 results stacked up against the same period last year. Plain and simple.

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q4 2024 | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Total Revenue** | $113.83 billion | $96.5 billion | +18% |
| **Net Income** | $34.46 billion | $26.54 billion | +30% |
| **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** | $2.82 | $2.15 | +31% |

### What's Working

**Search is still the cash cow.** Despite all the chatter about AI chatbots taking over, Google's search business is accelerating. Revenue from Search & other advertising hit roughly $70.9 billion for the quarter, a 17% jump from last year [4]. People are also using Search in new ways; the company noted that queries in its AI-powered search mode are three times longer than traditional searches [4].

**The Cloud business is exploding.** Google Cloud, which rents out computing power and AI tools to other companies, was the standout performer. Its revenue shot up 48% to $17.7 billion [2]. The demand for AI is so intense that Google Cloud now has a backlog of contracts worth a staggering $240 billion [4].

**Gemini is getting cheaper and more popular.** Google's flagship AI model, Gemini, now has over 750 million monthly active users. More importantly, the company has managed to slash the cost of running Gemini by 78% over the last year, making the whole operation much more efficient [4].

### What's Complicated

**YouTube ads were a little soft.** YouTube’s ad revenue grew 9% to $11.4 billion, which was a bit shy of what analysts had penciled in [2]. The company pointed out that it was a tough comparison to the end of 2024, which was flooded with political ad spending during the U.S. elections [2].

**“Other Bets” are still a moonshot.** This is Google’s division for experimental projects like the self-driving car company Waymo. This division lost $3.6 billion this quarter, a loss that was inflated by a large stock-based compensation charge for Waymo after it raised a new round of funding [2].

### The $185 Billion Bet on AI

The biggest takeaway from the report wasn’t the record revenue—it was the spending plan. Alphabet announced it expects to spend between $175 billion and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026 [3]. That’s nearly double what they spent in 2025.

> “We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board,” said CEO Sundar Pichai. “To meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities ahead of us, our 2026 CapEx investments are anticipated to be in the range of $175 to $185 billion.” [4]

This cash will be poured into building more data centers, buying more powerful chips, and generally beefing up the infrastructure needed to power the next generation of AI. It's a clear sign that Google is going all-in on the AI arms race.

### What to Watch

Google is in a fascinating spot. It’s a hugely profitable, mature company that’s investing with the aggression of a startup. The big question for the year ahead is how quickly these massive AI investments will translate into new products and even more growth. For now, Google is sending a clear message: the future is AI, and they’re building it, no matter the cost.
