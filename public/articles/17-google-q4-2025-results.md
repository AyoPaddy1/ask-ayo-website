### The Short of It

Google’s parent company, Alphabet, just finished its biggest year ever, pulling in over $400 billion in revenue for the first time [1]. They beat Wall Street's expectations for both revenue and profit in the last three months of 2025, with their Search and Cloud businesses growing faster than expected [2].

But here’s the twist: despite the great results, the stock price dipped. Why? Because Google announced plans to nearly double its spending in 2026, with a huge chunk of that money going towards building out its artificial intelligence capabilities [3]. It’s a massive bet on the future, and it’s making some investors a little nervous.

### The Numbers

Here’s how Alphabet’s Q4 2025 results stacked up against the same period last year:

| Metric | Q4 2025 | Q4 2024 | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Total Revenue** | $113.83 billion | $96.5 billion | +18% |
| **Net Income** | $34.46 billion | $26.54 billion | +30% |
| **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** | $2.82 | $2.15 | +31% |

They didn’t just grow; they beat the experts’ predictions across the board. Revenue was about $2.4 billion higher than analysts expected, and earnings per share came in at $2.82, comfortably ahead of the $2.63 estimate [2].

### What's Working

**Google Search is still the king.** Despite all the talk about AI chatbots replacing search engines, Google's search business is stronger than ever. Revenue grew by 17% this quarter, and the company says more people are using Search than ever before [4]. They’re also integrating their own AI, Gemini, into search results, which is leading to people asking longer, more complex questions.

**The Cloud business is on fire.** Google Cloud, which provides computing power and AI services to other businesses, was the real star of the show. Its revenue shot up by an incredible 48% to $17.7 billion [5]. The demand for AI is so high that Google Cloud's backlog of contracts now stands at a massive $240 billion [4].

### What's Complicated

**YouTube missed the mark (slightly).** While YouTube’s ad revenue still grew by 9% to $11.4 billion, it was a little less than what Wall Street was hoping for [2]. The company explained that this was partly because it was a tough comparison to the end of 2024, which had a lot of political ad spending from the U.S. elections [2].

**“Other Bets” are still losing money.** This is where Google puts its more experimental projects, like the self-driving car company Waymo. These bets lost a whopping $3.6 billion this quarter, partly because of a big accounting charge related to a new funding round for Waymo [2].

### The $185 Billion Bet on AI

The biggest headline from the earnings report wasn’t the record revenue; it was the spending plan. Alphabet announced it expects to spend between $175 billion and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026 [3]. That’s nearly double what they spent in 2025.

> “We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board,” said CEO Sundar Pichai. “To meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities ahead of us, our 2026 CapEx investments are anticipated to be in the range of $175 to $185 billion.” [4]

This money will go towards building more data centers, buying more powerful chips, and generally beefing up the infrastructure needed to power the next generation of AI. It’s a clear signal that Google is all-in on the AI arms race and is willing to spend whatever it takes to win.

### What to Watch

Google is in a fascinating position. It’s a massively profitable company that’s also investing like a startup. The big question for the next year will be whether these huge AI investments start to pay off in a way that satisfies investors. For now, Google is telling a clear story: the future is AI, and they’re building it, no matter the cost.
