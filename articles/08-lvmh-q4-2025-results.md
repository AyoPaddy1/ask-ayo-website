## The 30-Second Version

LVMH surprised investors with Q4 organic growth of +1%, defying analyst expectations of a decline. The world's largest luxury company reported Q4 revenue of €22.7 billion, showing resilience despite a challenging year. Full-year 2025 revenue fell 5% to €80.8 billion, but the company demonstrated "good resilience" and maintained profitability. The key takeaway: luxury isn't dead—it's stabilizing. Fashion & Leather Goods showed improvement in the second half, and Asia returned to growth after a brutal 2024. The stock could rally on this better-than-feared performance.

## The Numbers: Better Than Expected

| Metric | Actual | Previous (Q3 2025) | What It Means |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Q4 Revenue** | **€22.7B** | €18.28B (Q3) | Solid quarter-over-quarter growth |
| **Q4 Organic Growth** | **+1%** | +1% (Q3) | Positive growth maintained |
| **Full Year Revenue** | **€80.8B** | €84.7B (2024) | Down 5%, but expected |
| **Full Year Organic Growth** | **-1%** | +13% (2024) | Slowdown after exceptional years |
| **Operating Profit** | **€17.8B** | €19.6B (2024) | Down 9%, margins compressed |

**The surprise:** Analysts expected Q4 organic sales to decline 0.3%. Instead, LVMH posted +1% growth—a significant beat that signals stabilization.

## What Actually Happened

### The Turnaround Story: Growth Returns

After a brutal 2024 where luxury demand collapsed, LVMH's Q4 results suggest the worst is over. The company achieved **positive organic growth** in both Q3 and Q4 2025, marking a turning point after quarters of decline.

**Key quote from CEO Bernard Arnault:**
> "Once again in 2025, LVMH demonstrated its solidity and effective strategy upheld by its highly engaged teams. The Group was buoyed by the loyalty and growing demand shown by our local customers."

Translation: Local demand (not tourists) is driving growth. This is healthier and more sustainable than the post-Covid boom driven by Chinese tourists flooding Europe and Japan.

### Fashion & Leather Goods: The Crown Jewel Stabilizes

The division that includes Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, and Fendi saw **improvement in the second half of the year**. While full-year revenue fell 8% to €37.8 billion, the trajectory improved significantly:

- **First half 2025:** Steep declines
- **Second half 2025:** Stabilization and improvement
- **Q4 2025:** Continued positive momentum

**What's working:**
- **Louis Vuitton** maintained its position as the profit engine
- **Dior** showed resilience with strong brand campaigns
- **Loewe and Loro Piana** continued solid momentum
- **New creative directors** at Celine (Michael Rider) and Givenchy (Sarah Burton) bring fresh energy

**What's still challenging:**
- Entry-level luxury products remain weak (aspirational customers pulled back)
- China's local market is still recovering
- Pricing power is limited—can't raise prices in this environment

### Asia: The Comeback Begins

After crashing in 2024, **Asia (excluding Japan) returned to growth in the second half of 2025**. This is the most important signal in the entire earnings report.

**What changed:**
- Chinese consumers are spending again—but differently
- Growth is driven by local purchases, not travel
- "Quiet luxury" trend means less logo-heavy products, more understated elegance
- Government stimulus finally reaching consumers

**The catch:** Japan declined in 2025 after a stellar 2024. The yen strengthened, making Japan less attractive for tourist shopping. This was expected and doesn't change the positive Asia story.

### Wines & Spirits: Still Struggling

Revenue fell 9% to €5.4 billion, dragged down by:
- **Cognac tariffs:** China imposed anti-dumping measures on French brandy, directly hitting Hennessy
- **Champagne weakness:** Consumers pulled back on celebration spending
- **High comparisons:** Post-Covid boom years set a tough bar

This division will likely remain weak until geopolitical tensions ease and Chinese demand returns.

### The Bright Spots: Sephora Shines

**Selective Retailing** (Sephora + DFS) posted +4% organic growth, driven entirely by Sephora's "remarkable performance." Sephora continued to gain market share in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.

**Why Sephora is winning:**
- Beauty is more resilient than fashion in downturns
- Sephora's omnichannel strategy (stores + online + app) is best-in-class
- Exclusive brands and influencer partnerships drive traffic
- Lower price points than luxury fashion make it accessible

**Watches & Jewelry** also grew +3%, with Tiffany & Co. rolling out its new store concept and Bulgari celebrating its 140th anniversary.

## The Geographic Story

### Europe: Decline in Second Half
Europe saw a decline in the second half of 2025, likely due to:
- Weaker tourist spending (strong euro, visa issues)
- Local economic uncertainty
- Shift of Chinese spending back to Asia

### United States: Growth Continues
The U.S. posted growth, benefiting from:
- Solid local demand from wealthy consumers
- Strong Sephora performance
- Stable luxury market despite broader economic concerns

### Japan: Down After Stellar 2024
Japan declined in 2025 after being boosted by the weak yen in 2024. As the yen strengthened, tourist shopping became less attractive. This was expected and priced in.

### Asia (ex-Japan): Return to Growth
**This is the headline.** After a disastrous 2024, Asia returned to growth in the second half of 2025. Chinese consumers are back—spending locally, not traveling.

## What This Means for Investors

### The Bull Case Just Got Stronger

LVMH's Q4 results validate the bull thesis:
1. **The bottom is in:** Q3 and Q4 both posted positive growth
2. **Asia is recovering:** Chinese consumers are spending again
3. **Brand strength intact:** LVMH maintained pricing and didn't resort to discounting
4. **Profitability resilient:** Operating margin of 22% despite revenue decline
5. **Cash flow strong:** Operating free cash flow up 8% to €11.3 billion

**What this means:** The luxury downturn was cyclical, not structural. Demand is returning, and LVMH is positioned to benefit.

### The Bear Case Weakens

Bears argued that:
- Chinese consumers were gone for good ❌ (They're back)
- Luxury was in permanent decline ❌ (Growth returned)
- LVMH would have to discount ❌ (Maintained pricing power)

The Q4 results don't prove the bears wrong entirely, but they significantly weaken the bear case.

### Stock Reaction: Likely Positive

Expect the stock to rally 3-7% on this news because:
- Results beat low expectations
- Growth trajectory is improving
- Asia recovery is the signal investors wanted
- Cash flow and profitability remain strong

## The Big Picture: Luxury is Stabilizing

LVMH's Q4 results tell a clear story: **The luxury downturn is ending.**

After several years of exceptional post-Covid growth, the industry went through a painful normalization in 2024 and early 2025. Aspirational customers pulled back. Chinese consumers stayed home. Brands couldn't raise prices.

But Q4 2025 shows the tide is turning:
- **Organic growth returned** (+1% in Q4)
- **Asia is recovering** (second-half growth)
- **Local demand is strong** (less reliance on tourists)
- **Profitability is resilient** (22% operating margin)

**The question now:** Is this the start of a sustained recovery, or just a temporary bounce?

**The answer:** It's too early to say, but the signs are encouraging. If Q1 2026 shows continued growth, the recovery thesis will be confirmed.

## What Management Said

### On 2025 Performance:
> "LVMH showed good resilience and maintained its innovative momentum despite a disrupted geopolitical and economic environment."

### On Asia Recovery:
> "The rest of Asia saw a noticeable improvement in trends with respect to 2024, with a return to growth in the second half of the year."

### On 2026 Outlook:
> "In an environment that remains uncertain, our Maisons' ability to inspire dreams—coupled with the highest levels of vigilance with regard to cost management, and our environmental and social commitments—will once again be a decisive asset underscoring our leadership position in the luxury goods market."

**Translation:** We're cautiously optimistic. The recovery is real, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves.

## Jargon, Explained

**Organic Growth:** Revenue growth excluding currency effects and acquisitions. LVMH's +1% organic growth in Q4 means actual sales at existing stores grew 1% after adjusting for currency swings. This is the cleanest measure of business performance.

**Operating Margin:** Operating profit divided by revenue. LVMH's 22% operating margin means for every €100 in sales, they keep €22 as operating profit. This is exceptionally high and shows the power of luxury brands.

**Fashion & Leather Goods:** LVMH's largest and most profitable division, representing about 50% of profit. Includes Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Loewe, Fendi, Givenchy, and others. When this division performs well, the entire company benefits.

**Asia (ex-Japan):** Industry term for mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. LVMH tracks this separately from Japan because consumer behavior is different. China is the world's largest luxury market, so this metric is critical.

**Operating Free Cash Flow:** Cash generated from operations after capital expenditures. LVMH's €11.3 billion in operating free cash flow shows the company generates massive cash even in a down year. This cash funds dividends, buybacks, and acquisitions.

## The Bottom Line

LVMH delivered a better-than-expected Q4, with +1% organic growth defying analyst predictions of a decline. The world's largest luxury company showed resilience despite a challenging 2025, with Asia returning to growth and Fashion & Leather Goods stabilizing.

**Three key takeaways:**
1. **The bottom is in:** Positive growth in Q3 and Q4 signals the worst is over
2. **Asia is back:** Chinese consumers are spending again, locally
3. **Profitability intact:** 22% operating margin and strong cash flow despite revenue decline

**What to watch in 2026:** If Q1 shows continued growth, the recovery thesis will be confirmed. If growth stalls, it suggests the Q4 bounce was temporary.

For now, LVMH's Q4 results suggest luxury is stabilizing—not dead, just normalizing after exceptional post-Covid years.
