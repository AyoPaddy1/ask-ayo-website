## The Golden Rule: Education, Not Advice

We are an education platform, not a financial advisor. Our goal is to explain complex financial topics in plain English so our users can make their own informed decisions. We must never tell them what to do.

### Compliance Rules (No Exceptions)

- **Never say "Buy," "Sell," or "Hold."** We can explain what these terms mean, but we must never apply them to a specific stock.
- **Never use the word "Undervalued" or "Overvalued."** We can explain the concept of valuation, but we must not apply it to a specific stock.
- **Never give price targets.** We can report on analyst price targets, but we must attribute them and never state them as our own opinion.
- **Always include the "Education, not advice" footer.** Every page must have a clear disclaimer that our content is for informational purposes only.

### Verified Data Only

As established in `EARNINGS_RULES.md`, all factual claims must be backed by verified data from official sources. This applies to all content, not just earnings articles.

- **No AI-recalled facts:** The AI should not be used to generate any factual data (e.g., market cap, revenue, EPS). It should only be used to write a narrative around data that has been provided to it from a verified source.
- **Cite your sources:** For any data point that is not common knowledge, include a link to the source.

## Writing Standards

Our writing style is a key part of our brand. It should be clear, concise, and human. See `MESSAGING.md` for more details on our tone of voice.

### No LLM-Style Writing

We are a human-centric brand, and our writing should reflect that. Avoid the following common LLM patterns:

- **No excessive hyphens:** Do not use hyphens for emphasis. Use bold or italics instead.
- **No "fluff" words:** Avoid phrases like "delve into," "it's worth noting," "in conclusion," "the landscape of...," "in the world of..."
- **Be direct:** Get to the point quickly. Don't waste time with long introductions.

### Example of Good vs. Bad Copy

**BAD (LLM-style):**
> In the ever-evolving landscape of the automotive industry, it's worth noting that Tesla's delivery numbers are a key metric for investors to delve into. In conclusion, these figures provide a snapshot of the company's performance.

**GOOD (AYO-style):**
> Tesla's delivery numbers are the best way to track its growth. Here's what they mean, and why investors watch them so closely.

## Using Annual Reports (10-K Filings)

Annual reports are a goldmine of information, but they are dense and full of jargon. Our job is to translate them.

- **Focus on strategic context:** Don't just report the numbers. Explain what they mean for the company's strategy. What are the risks? What are the opportunities? What is the company focused on for the next year?
- **Use the "Business" and "Risk Factors" sections:** These sections provide a wealth of information about the company's strategy, competition, and challenges. They are often more valuable than the financial statements themselves.
- **Translate management jargon:** The "Management's Discussion and Analysis" (MD&A) section is where the company explains its performance. Our job is to translate this into plain English.
