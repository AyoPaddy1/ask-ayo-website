# Ask AYO Messaging Framework

**Last updated:** January 31, 2026

## Mission

Our mission is to **break down the language barrier of finance**. We believe financial literacy shouldn't require learning a new language. We translate Wall Street into words you actually use.

## Tagline

**Financial BS → Plain English**

## Use Cases

We focus on four key use cases where people encounter financial jargon:

| Use Case | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 📈 | Investing | Finally understand the brands you invest in. |
| 📰 | News | Finally make sense of business headlines. |
| 💼 | Work | Finally decode what your CFO is actually saying. |
| 🏠 | Your Money | Finally understand what your bank is actually saying. |

This is reflected in our navigation and on the homepage. Each use case has a dedicated page that explains how AYO helps in that context.

## Tone of Voice

Our tone is **clear, confident, and a little bit cheeky**. We are the friend who knows finance but explains it without being condescending. We are warm, not clever. We are simple, not simplistic.

### Writing Rules

- **No LLM-style writing:** Avoid phrases like "delve into," "it's worth noting," "in conclusion," or "the landscape of..."
- **No excessive hyphens:** Don't use hyphens for emphasis. Use bold or italics instead.
- **Short sentences:** Keep sentences and paragraphs short and easy to read.
- **Use real-world examples:** Explain concepts with relatable analogies (e.g., "basis points" is just "percentages with attitude").
- **Be direct:** Get to the point quickly. Don't waste time with long introductions.
- **Use the "Finally" pattern:** Frame the benefit of each use case around the feeling of "finally" understanding something complex.

### Example of Good vs. Bad Copy

**BAD (LLM-style):**
> In the ever-evolving landscape of personal finance, it's worth noting that understanding complex financial instruments is paramount. For instance, when delving into the intricacies of your mortgage, it's crucial to grasp the nuances of amortization schedules.

**GOOD (AYO-style):**
> Finally understand what your bank is actually saying.
> Your mortgage statement shouldn't be a mystery. We'll explain what amortization means in plain English.
