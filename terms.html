            <h3>⚠️ Not Financial Advice</h3>
            <p><strong>AYO provides educational explanations only. We are NOT an investment advisor, broker, or fiduciary. Do not make investment decisions based solely on AYO. Always consult a qualified financial professional.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By installing, accessing, or using the Ask AYO Chrome Extension ("AYO", "the Extension", "the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use AYO.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>AYO is a Chrome Extension that provides instant, plain-English explanations of financial terminology. When you highlight a financial term on any webpage and right-click to select "Ask AYO", the Extension displays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A formal definition of the term</li>
            <li>A "Real Talk" translation in conversational language</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AYO is designed to help users understand financial jargon while reading news, reports, forums, and other online content.</p>

        <h2>3. Not Investment Advice</h2>
        <div class="highlight">

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Always do your own research and consult a qualified financial advisor before making investment decisions.</strong></p>
